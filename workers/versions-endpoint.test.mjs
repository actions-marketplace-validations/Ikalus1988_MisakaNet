// `GET /api/versions` — the machine-readable answer to "which number is which" (intake #2486, decision D5).
//
// Three version channels move independently (release / registry listing / npm bundle) and a plugin market
// shows the *manifest* version while install docs quote the release line, so a reader comparing two numbers
// on one page concluded the page was broken. This endpoint is the comparison: every channel with its source
// and its value read live, plus the capability surface and what was actually verified.
//
// What this file pins: that it is an **aggregator** (it reads the worker's own constant, never a literal), that
// each source degrades to null with the source still named (an endpoint about versions must not fail when one
// of five fetches does), and that the notes which prevent the original misreading are present.
//
// Run: node --test workers/versions-endpoint.test.mjs
