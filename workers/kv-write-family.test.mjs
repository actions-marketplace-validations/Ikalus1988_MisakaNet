// Which key family spends the free tier's KV write allowance (2026-09-20, #1890).
//
// The quota counts *distinct keys written per day* (1,000 on the free plan), not write operations, which
// is why an earlier attempt to pick the next migration target went wrong: it ranked families by how many
// keys exist in the namespace and named `node:`, `mcp_token:` and `client:` — three families that already
// write through `storePut` (D1 first, KV only as a fallback) and therefore cost the KV budget nothing.
// Measure, then move.
//
// These tests pin the measurement itself: the family mapping (the bucket becomes a D1 row key, so the set
// is bounded on purpose), the "distinct key once per isolate" rule (rewrites of the same key are free, and
// the quota charges in the same shape), and that the counter never routes through `kvPut` — its own KV
// fallback sits one call away and would recurse the moment D1 was unhappy.

 * the durable store (#2118, #2117), and that is the *point* of the migration: in a deployment with D1
 * bound, no endpoint's happy path writes KV any more.
 *
 * What the ranking measures now is the **fallback** — `storePut` calls `kvPut` when D1 is unhappy,
 * which is exactly when KV's budget gets spent by surprise (the 1,350 writes on 2026-09-22 that could
 * not be attributed to any scheduled job). There is no HTTP surface that reliably reproduces "D1 is
 * unhealthy" from a test, so the test drives `kvPut` directly: the call `noteKvWriteFamily` sits in.
