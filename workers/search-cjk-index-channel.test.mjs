// The CJK side of the index — written, stored, and deliberately not read yet (issue #2355).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `bm25Tokenize` drops CJK entirely (`[^a-z0-9]+` → space), so a Chinese question
// reached the scorer with **zero** terms and returned `[]`, and a Chinese *lesson* contributed no term
// statistics to the index at all. Measured on production MCP (2026-09-27):
//
//   `macOS Chrome headless PDF 写完了但进程不退`  → the right lesson (the Latin half carried it)
//   `wsl2 landlock 文件系统沙箱`                  → an **unrelated** lesson (`chrome-relay-…`), because
//                                                   the two Latin tokens decided the answer
//
// The tokenizer half landed in #2361 (`cjkBigrams()`); this is the index channel that consumes it. Rank
// fusion landed in #2356 (`rankCjkChannel` + `fuseRankings`, tested in `search-cjk-fusion.test.mjs`) and the
// confidently-wrong case stays pinned in #2358 — **nothing in this file changes what a query returns**,
// which was the point: the write side was reviewable and mergeable on its own.
//
// The three risks the design named, and the check for each:
//
//   1. **English dilution.** `avgDocLen` normalises every document's BM25 score (`b = 0.75`), so a
//      bigram stream mixed into the shared text would move every English score even though no English
//      token changed. The channel is a separate map with its own lengths, and the test below proves the
//      English half is byte-identical to a build without the channel.
//   2. **Index growth.** The row is gzip+base64 in one store row and D1 caps a row at 2 MB — the ceiling
//      that froze search on 2026-09-26. The last test measures the real corpus and fails if the stored
//      size approaches that ceiling (the design's answer then is a row of its own, not a thinner
//      channel).
//   3. **A stale build served as if it had the channel.** `INDEX_TEXT_VERSION` 3 → 4, and the index
//      records it, so `refreshSearchIndex`'s `textChanged` rebuilds instead of serving an English-only
//      index to a CJK query.
//
// Run: node --test workers/search-cjk-index-channel.test.mjs
