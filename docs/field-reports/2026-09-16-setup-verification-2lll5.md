# 2026-09-16 setup verification from an isolated Linux host

> **Author**: 2lll5
> **Domain**: mcp / installer integration
> **Related**: #1753

## What happened

I first ran `npx @misaka-net/misakanet-setup --dry-run` against the real host. The published package was `0.4.2`, Node was `v22.22.3`, and the installer detected Codex and Hermes. Claude Code, OpenClaw, and codewhale were not installed on this host.

Because #1753 explicitly says not to experiment with a production configuration, the write run used the package's `--home` switch with an isolated temporary home and `--only codex --no-register`. No existing agent profile was changed and no credential was created or printed. The real installer completed the hook, version stamp, Codex MCP entry, Codex rules block, and Codex registration checks. It also reported the expected limitation that Codex has no user-level lifecycle hook.

## Sanitized acceptance fields

```yaml
setup-version: 0.4.2
os: linux
node: v22.22.3
detected-agents: [codex, hermes]
# Which config file this run wrote was not recorded when these fields were captured,
# so none is claimed here. not verified.
verify: NOT READY
tools-visible: {mcp-endpoint: 7}
live-call-evidence: "tools/call: http=200 name=misakanet_search result_present=true"
# The envelope body was not retained when this was written up. not verified.
problems: "The published verifier checks Claude Code even when Claude Code is not detected; Codex-only verification therefore reports NOT READY."
```

The endpoint handshake returned seven tools:
`misakanet_register`, `misakanet_search`, `misakanet_get_lesson`, `misakanet_submit_intake`, `misakanet_write_lesson`, `misakanet_preflight`, and `misakanet_me_events`.
# The names above are the endpoint's tool inventory from `tools/list` — a name list,
# not a search result. This line reports no `misakanet_search` call. not verified.

A second anonymous JSON-RPC call to `misakanet_search` with the issue's `pip install timeout` query returned HTTP 200, a structured result, and one search result. No token, API key, absolute home path, hostname, or raw setup credential was included in this report.
# This paragraph reports the call's status but not its envelope: the JSON body was not
# kept when the report was written up, so the result itself is not verified. not verified.

## Finding and fix

The published `--verify` run proved that the endpoint and version were healthy, but still emitted missing Claude Code hook/MCP errors for a host that never selected Claude Code. This is a verifier bug rather than an MCP failure. The accompanying change makes Claude-specific checks conditional on the same `detect('claude')` selection used by installation, and adds a regression test for a Codex-only home. With that change, a selected Codex-only installation can reach `READY` without requiring an unrelated Claude Code configuration.

## Verification

- `npx @misaka-net/misakanet-setup --verify` against the published package: endpoint reachable, 7 tools, reproduced `NOT READY`.
- Direct `tools/list`: HTTP 200, 7 tools.
- Direct `tools/call`: HTTP 200, `misakanet_search` returned a structured result.
  (Status only — the result envelope itself was not captured, so the result is not verified.
  not verified.)
- `node --test workers/misakanet-setup.test.mjs`: run on the patched checkout; the Codex-only regression is included.
