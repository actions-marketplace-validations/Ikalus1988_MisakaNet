# Testing the DSH client half from a checkout

**Who this is for.** Someone who wants to look at MisakaNet inside DeepSeek Harness — the six seats
[bounty #2593](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/issues/2593) asks about — without waiting for an npm
release and **without touching the harness profile they use every day**.

Sibling documents: [`docs/compatibility.md`](../compatibility.md) (which host lines were measured, and what
each seat is), [`docs/maintainer/client-half-acceptance.md`](../maintainer/client-half-acceptance.md) (the
per-surface acceptance list), [`docs/integration/deepseek-harness.md`](../integration/deepseek-harness.md)
(the tools-only install guide).

## 1. npm lags main — which surfaces you get depends on where you install from

`dsh plugin --profile web add misakanet` resolves the **published** package. The published package is
whatever `npm`'s `latest` points at, and that is not `main`:

```console
$ curl -sS https://registry.npmjs.org/misakanet | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['dist-tags'])"
{'latest': '2.40.0'}

$ git show origin/main:lib/client.js | wc -c
101175
$ git ls-tree origin/main locale/ lib/
100644 blob 60be061cc1a4b70b85d2788bd2fe6106ae6909e6	lib/client.js
100644 blob 4aa69d425c0c3ea17cf3e39c94770371e836abc4	locale/en.json
100644 blob 77338605276710463126b4823000004a1c3a6757	locale/zh.json
```

The 2.40.0 tarball's `lib/client.js` is **50,486 bytes** and carries **no `locale/` directory**. So:

| Where you install from | Surfaces you get |
| --- | --- |
| `misakanet` on npm (`latest` = **2.40.0**) | the **five** 2.40.0 seats: left column (the permanent entry **and** the `main` page it opens — one row in the README), conversation tab, right column, tool-call rows, 👍/👎 action row. The bounty asks about them as six because it counts the entry and its page separately |
| **this working tree** (`main`, ahead of npm) | the above **plus** everything merged since: `/misakanet` in the composer, the frame-wide toast, the sidebar-foot action, Settings → General, the plugin page, and the packaged Chinese/English locales |

The second row is what the bounty needs. The extra surfaces are carried by **2.41.0**, whose release PR is
[#2591](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/pull/2591) — until that merges, the only way to see them is
to install from a checkout. Verify the shape of the gap yourself at any time:

```bash
npm view misakanet version                      # the published one
git -C <checkout> rev-parse --short HEAD        # the tree you are about to test
git -C <checkout> show HEAD:lib/client.js | wc -c
```

Related, and owned elsewhere: the README's per-surface version columns are
[#2640](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/issues/2640); the disposable path is `dsh plugin add` with a
*directory*, shown below.

## 2. The one-command probe — run this first

The repository already ships the measurement that answers "does the browser half exist on my host". It
refuses any `DSH_HOME` outside the temp directory, boots a throwaway host, and writes its JSON even when it
fails:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_smoke.py dsh-client --repo . --out /tmp/install-dsh.json
```

`--serve` keeps that host running and prints its URL for you to click — a disposable host to take bounty
screenshots in, with no manual wiring:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_smoke.py dsh-client --repo . --serve
```

Measured on 2026-10-01 (`dsh 0.2.0-rc.2`, this repository's `main`):

```console
$ python3 scripts/install_smoke.py dsh-client --repo .
{
  "form": "dsh-client",
  "ok": true,
  "checks": [
    "empty DSH_HOME at /tmp/misakanet-dsh-smoke-380b811_ (never the owner's)",
    "`dsh plugin add` put misakanet in dsh.profile.bundles",
    "host booted on http://127.0.0.1:58615/ (startup check passed)",
    "boot graph entry: {\"id\": \"misakanet\", \"url\": \"plugins/??misakanet/client.js&rev=2bb1be0d9e3e\", \"rev\": \"2bb1be0d9e3e\", \"inject\": [\"@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-chat\", \"@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-conversation\", \"@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar-right\", \"@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-tool\"]}",
    "the host echoed the declared inject order (4 packages)",
    "the combo route serves lib/client.js verbatim (no build step, no chunk)",
    "the served bundle registers all 7 seats"
  ],
  "failures": []
}
```

That proves the bundle is installed, the host starts, and the seats are *registered*. It does **not** drive a
browser, so it cannot tell you a seat *renders* — that is what the manual path below is for, and what
#2593's screenshots are for.

## 3. The manual path, copy-pasteable

Do this in a checkout of the repository (`git clone https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet.git`, or the
worktree you already have). No build step is needed: `lib/client.js` is served verbatim from the tree.

> **Never do this against your daily `~/.dsh`.** `dsh plugin --profile web add <path>` edits **that
> profile's** `package.json` and `bundles` list. Adding or removing a bundle while a host is running leaves
> it silently unloaded, and a broken bundle in a profile makes the host *refuse to start* and take every
> unrelated plugin in that profile with it. The `DSH_HOME` below is a throwaway directory for exactly that
> reason.

```bash
REPO=/path/to/your/MisakaNet            # the checkout you want to test
HOMEDIR=/tmp/dsh-client-half            # disposable — deleted in §6
PORT=41337

rm -rf "$HOMEDIR" && mkdir -p "$HOMEDIR"
export DSH_HOME="$HOMEDIR"
export npm_config_cache="$HOMEDIR/npm-cache"   # keep pnpm's cache inside the throwaway home too
```

**Install this working tree into the throwaway profile.** A *path* is a valid argument — that is what the
probe in §2 does:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add "$REPO"
```

Check what the profile now holds, instead of trusting the installer's exit code:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web list
cat "$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/package.json"     # bundles should name misakanet
```

Observed on 2026-10-01 in a throwaway profile: a local install lands in that file as a **link**
(`"misakanet": "link:/path/to/your/MisakaNet"`), not a copied tarball. Practical consequence: the profile
points at your tree, so remove the plugin or delete the `DSH_HOME` when you are done with that tree.

### Seed one workspace before the first boot (this is the "composer never mounts" trap)

A completely fresh `DSH_HOME` has **zero** workspaces, so the composer mounts as its workspace chooser
instead of a composer — `[role=textbox]` is labelled `Choose workspace`, the body says `Choose a workspace to
start`. Nothing is broken and **nothing is logged**: the domain silently drops a workspace record that does
not satisfy its schema, and the chosen-looking symptom is a textbox nobody can type into.

It also has **no `storages/` directory**: `dsh plugin --profile web add` writes `profiles/web/` and nothing
else, so the `workspace.json` write below creates that directory first. Skip it and the seed fails outright,
before the host is involved at all:

```console
$ python3 - "$HOMEDIR" "$REPO" <<'PY'     # the seed block below, without its mkdir -p
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/dsh-client-half/storages/workspace.json'
```

The record needs `createdAt` and `updatedAt`. Without them it is rejected with no error; with them the host
creates the first session itself on page load, which is the way the host supports it. A/B measured on
2026-10-01 (`dsh 0.2.0-rc.2`), with those two fields as the only difference:

| seeded record | `[role=textbox]` aria-label | page body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| missing `createdAt`/`updatedAt` | `Choose workspace` | `No sessions yet` / `Choose a workspace to start` |
| with them | `Describe what you want to build, / commands, @ files or sessions` | composer is live |

Do not try to *drive* the chooser as a workaround: adding a workspace through the real UI goes through a
native directory picker that a headless browser cannot open, and a chooser that accepts a click while the
record is dropped is how this trap stays invisible — the composer is still inert and still logs nothing. The
per-surface list this step feeds is
[`docs/maintainer/client-half-acceptance.md`](../maintainer/client-half-acceptance.md).

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOMEDIR/storages"      # `dsh plugin --profile web add` does not create it
python3 - "$HOMEDIR" "$REPO" <<'PY'
import json, pathlib, sys, uuid
from datetime import datetime, timezone

home, repo = pathlib.Path(sys.argv[1]), pathlib.Path(sys.argv[2]).resolve()
(home / "storages").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
now = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat().replace("+00:00", "Z")
wid = str(uuid.uuid4())
(home / "storages" / "workspace.json").write_text(json.dumps({
    "unit": {"name": "workspace", "version": 2},
    "global": {"initialized": True, "workspaceIds": [wid],
               "archivedSessionIds": [], "pinnedSessionIds": []},
    "tables": {"workspaces": {wid: {
        "path": str(repo), "title": repo.name, "sessionIds": [],
        "createdAt": now, "updatedAt": now}}},
}), encoding="utf-8")
print("seeded workspace", wid, "->", repo)
PY
```

Run on a brand-new `DSH_HOME` on 2026-10-01 (`dsh 0.2.0-rc.2`): without the `mkdir -p`, the seed exits 1
with the `FileNotFoundError` above; with it, the record is on disk and the host boots off that home:

```console
$ dsh plugin --profile web add "$REPO"
dsh: initialized profile web at /tmp/dsh-client-half/profiles/web
+ misakanet link:/path/to/your/MisakaNet
Done in 338ms using pnpm v11.9.0

$ ls -d "$HOMEDIR/storages"
ls: cannot access '/tmp/dsh-client-half/storages': No such file or directory

$ mkdir -p "$HOMEDIR/storages"
$ python3 - "$HOMEDIR" "$REPO" <<'PY'      # the seed block above
seeded workspace 1c537fe5-8ab3-451a-9862-6be52bc62ef9 -> /path/to/your/MisakaNet
PY

$ ls -l "$HOMEDIR/storages/workspace.json"
-rw-r--r-- 1 you you 422 Oct  2 01:38 /tmp/dsh-client-half/storages/workspace.json

$ dsh --profile web --no-open --port "$PORT" >"$HOMEDIR/host.log" 2>&1 &
$ cat "$HOMEDIR/host.log"
dsh web: http://127.0.0.1:41337/?token=…        # the host is up on the throwaway home
```

### Boot the host

```bash
dsh --profile web --no-open --port "$PORT" >"$HOMEDIR/host.log" 2>&1 &
# the URL is written about a second after the process starts, so poll for it instead of reading once
URL=""
for _ in $(seq 75); do                    # 75 × 2s = 150s, the same bound the e2e runner waits
  URL=$(grep -o "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/?token=[A-Za-z0-9_-]*" "$HOMEDIR/host.log" | head -1)
  [ -n "$URL" ] && break
  sleep 2
done
if [ -z "$URL" ]; then
  echo "the host never printed its URL within 150s; last lines of $HOMEDIR/host.log:" >&2
  tail -20 "$HOMEDIR/host.log" >&2
  exit 1
fi
echo "$URL"
```

Read the log **once** right after `&` and you get an empty line, not an error — the host writes
`dsh web: http://127.0.0.1:41337/?token=…` a second later, on a brand-new home as much as on a warm one. The
loop above is the shell form of `wait_for_url()` in `tests/e2e/run_client_e2e.py`: bounded, and on timeout it
prints the log tail instead of nothing.

The printed URL carries a one-time token — open the **full URL including `?token=…`**. It is a credential
for your throwaway host, so keep it out of screenshots.

### The two first-run dialogs swallow every click

A fresh profile opens two blockers before the app is usable, and both *must* be dismissed or every later
click lands on the dialog:

1. **Preview Notice** → click **Continue** (this is the host's preview acknowledgement, not MisakaNet's);
2. **Add an API key to get started** → click **Configure later** — testing the client half needs no
   credentials.

Both headings and both button labels are the host's own strings (`dsh-client-ui-settings-models`), and both
were observed on a fresh throwaway home on 2026-10-01.

**Continue is not always clickable** (#2916, measured 2026-10-06 on dsh 0.2.0-rc.2). On a host with no LLM
credentials it renders `disabled`, and it then detaches itself while you retry — the page advances the
notice on its own. A script that does `if button.count(): button.click(timeout=8000)` therefore burns the
full timeout and raises `TimeoutError: element is not enabled / element was detached from the DOM`. That is
a fact about the host's first-run flow, not about the plugin. If your script hits it, either click only when
the control is enabled or treat "the dialog went away by itself" as dismissed. Then check the composer is
the real one:

```bash
# in the page: the composer is live when [role=textbox] is labelled
#   "Describe what you want to build, / commands, @ files or sessions"
# if it still says "Choose workspace", the seeded record was rejected — re-read the section above.
```

## 4. Seat checklist

Take these in order; each row says what it looks like when it is there. The bounty's screenshots are the
left-column entry + the page it opens (seats 1–2), and one session surface with data in it (seats 3–6 after a
search).

**2.40.0 carries five seats, and the bounty asks about them as six**: the README's 2.40.0 table describes the
left-column entry and the `main` page it opens as **one** row, while the bounty numbers them 1 and 2. Every
one of the six is in the published package, and the slot each registers is what says so:

| Seat (bounty #2593) | Slot | In 2.40.0? | README row |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Left column, under `Plugins` | `sidebar.panellist` | ✅ | the 1st of the five |
| 2. `main` page | `main` | ✅ | the same row as seat 1 |
| 3. Conversation tab ring | `conversation.view` | ✅ | the 2nd |
| 4. Right column pane | `sidebar.right.pane.tab` | ✅ | the 3rd |
| 5. Tool call rows | `tool.call.toolview` | ✅ | the 4th |
| 6. Assistant action row | `conversation.chat.assistant-actions` | ✅ | the 5th |

You can check that against the published tarball instead of taking this page's word for it — the slots the
bundle reaches for are the seats it draws:

```console
$ npm pack misakanet@2.40.0 --pack-destination /tmp && tar xzf /tmp/misakanet-2.40.0.tgz -C /tmp
$ grep -oE '(registerWhenDeclared|slots\.inject)\("[a-z.]+"' /tmp/package/lib/client.js | sed 's/.*("//' | sort -u
conversation.view"
main"
sidebar.panellist"
sidebar.right.pane.tab"
sidebar.right.pane.tab.title"
tool.call.toolview"
```

`conversation.chat.assistant-actions` (seat 6) is a child slot declared by a parent entry, so it does not
appear in that list; the bundle's own comments name it, and it renders on the finalized answer. The same
command on a **checkout** bundle also lists the 2.41.0 slots: `conversation.input.overlay` (`/misakanet`),
`shell.overlay` (the toast), `sidebar.footer.action`, `settings.general.item`, and
`plugins.bundle.config` / `plugins.row.config` (the plugin page).

The full slot-vs-scope table, with the host's own contract text quoted, is in
[`docs/compatibility.md`](../compatibility.md).

| Seat (bounty #2593) | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Left column, under `Plugins` | a permanent **MisakaNet** entry, drawn as an icon; it is a shortcut, not the panel. If the column is collapsed, screenshot the rail icon. |
| 2. `main` page | what that entry opens — the browser-scoped MisakaNet view. |
| 3. Conversation tab ring | a **MisakaNet** tab beside Chat and Trajectory. |
| 4. Right column pane | the same panel as a pane, beside the other tools. |
| 5. Tool call rows | one row per `misakanet_search` / `misakanet_submit_intake` call, on the tool card. |
| 6. Assistant action row | 👍 / 👎 on a finalized answer that used a lesson. |

All six of those seats ship in 2.40.0 — the release the bounty is written against. On a **checkout** install
you should also see the surfaces that are **not** in 2.40.0 and ship in **2.41.0**
([release PR #2591](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/pull/2591)):

* `/misakanet` in the composer,
* the frame-wide toast after a search,
* the sidebar-foot action,
* Settings → General,
* the plugin page's read-only MCP row,
* the packaged Chinese/English locales.

Report those as *found* only if you installed from a checkout; on the npm 2.40.0 package their absence is
expected, not a bug. The voice-cue switch is **not** on that list — it is drawn inside the panel, and
`"Voice cues: off"` is already in the 2.40.0 tarball's `lib/client.js`.

To get data into a session surface (seat 3–6), ask the agent to search, e.g. *"search MisakaNet for
`pip install timeout`"*: the search row and the panel then have content, and the toast appears once the
search returns lessons.

## 5. What to report, and where

Evidence is the deliverable — command plus output, not a description:

* comment on [#2593](https://github.com/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet/issues/2593) with the screenshots and the probe
  JSON from §2, plus your environment (`dsh --version`, OS, fresh or pre-existing profile);
* report anything that broke through `misakanet_submit_intake` (`kind="missing_lesson"`) and link the
  returned `dedup_key`;
* "the host refuses to start" is a finding worth its own line — paste the last lines of `$HOMEDIR/host.log`.

## 6. Cleanup

```bash
lsof -ti tcp:$PORT | xargs -r kill      # kill by port, never by a pattern that could match your own shell
dsh plugin --profile web remove misakanet   # while the host is stopped (see the warning in §3)
rm -rf "$HOMEDIR"                        # the whole disposable profile, cache and sessions
unset DSH_HOME npm_config_cache
```

`DSH_HOME` is exported for that shell; if you opened a new shell to test, it is already gone. Removing a
bundle from a **running** host leaves it silently unloaded — stop the host first, or use the GUI.

If you used a git worktree for the checkout, remove it from the repository it was created in:

```bash
git -C /path/to/MisakaNet worktree remove --force /tmp/wf-yourname
```
