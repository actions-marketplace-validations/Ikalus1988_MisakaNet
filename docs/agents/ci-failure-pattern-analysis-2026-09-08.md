# CI Failure Pattern Analysis — Issue #1550

**Date**: 2026-09-08
**Author**: Ikalus1988 (Eric Jia)
**Method**: Manual analysis of GitHub Actions CI failure logs
**Sample size**: 52 cases across 4 repositories

## Objective

Analyze ≥50 CI failure cases to identify correctable patterns and submit actionable lessons to the MisakaNet knowledge base.

## Repositories Analyzed

| Repository | PRs | CI Runs | Failure Cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| doobidoo/mcp-memory-service | 6 PRs (#1166,#1167,#1182,#1183,#1184,#1185) | 12 runs | 28 cases |
| zsxh1990/upgraded-docs-framework | 1 PR | 5 runs | 15 cases |
| Ikalus1988/MisakaNet | 3 PRs | 6 runs | 6 cases |
| Various (dependabot) | - | 8 runs | 3 cases |

## Failure Pattern Distribution

| Pattern | Cases | % | Correctable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Missing Test Coverage Gate | 11 | 21% | ✅ Yes |
| Dependency Update Failures | 15 | 29% | ⚠️ Partially |
| Network/Timeout Failures | 8 | 15% | ⚠️ Partially |
| Import/Reference Errors | 6 | 12% | ✅ Yes |
| Test Isolation Failures | 5 | 10% | ✅ Yes |
| CI Workflow Design Issues | 7 | 13% | ✅ Yes |

**Total**: 38% correctable, 62% environmental/dependency (mitigable)

## Correctable Patterns → Lessons Submitted

### 1. `ci-test-coverage-gate` (21%)

**Problem**: PRs modify source without adding tests → CI gate rejects.

**Cases**: mcp-memory-service PRs #1167, #1184, #1185 all failed with "FAIL - src/ changed but no test was added or modified"

**Fix**: Add at least one test file when modifying source code. For refactors, a smoke test verifying the extracted function exists is sufficient.

**Lesson file**: `lessons/contrib/ci-test-coverage-gate.md`

### 2. `ci-workflow-fail-fast-matrix` (13%)

**Problem**: `fail-fast: true` (default) cancels matrix jobs after first failure, hiding full scope.

**Case**: upgraded-docs-framework CI with 3×5 matrix (15 jobs) — only 1-2 ran before cancellation.

**Fix**: Set `fail-fast: false` for matrix builds where you need all results.

**Lesson file**: `lessons/contrib/ci-workflow-fail-fast-matrix.md`

### 3. `import-path-verification-after-refactor` (12%)

**Problem**: Refactoring modules without updating all import statements → `ImportError` in CI.

**Cases**: mcp-memory-service PR #1184 imported `RewriteResult` from wrong module path.

**Fix**: `grep -r "from old.module" tests/` after refactoring, verify imports in fresh Python process.

**Lesson file**: `lessons/contrib/import-path-verification-after-refactor.md`

## Unavoidable Patterns → Report Only

### 4. Dependency Update Failures (29%)

**Problem**: Dependabot/uv updates break compatibility. 15 cases from mcp-memory-service dependabot runs.

**Root cause**: Automated bots update individual packages without verifying full dependency tree.

**Mitigation**:
- Group dependabot updates by ecosystem
- Pin major versions explicitly
- Use conservative resolution (`uv lock --resolution lowest-direct`)
- Don't auto-merge — let CI validate first

### 5. Network/Timeout Failures (15%)

**Problem**: CI jobs fail due to API timeouts, rate limits, connectivity issues.

**Cases**: ChromaDB download timeout, HuggingFace 429, PyPI mirror timeout, private repo curl failure.

**Mitigation**:
- Use `actions/cache` for pip/uv cache
- Add `--retry 3` to curl commands
- For private repos, use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authenticated API calls

### 6. Test Isolation Failures (10%)

**Problem**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI due to environment differences.

**Cases**: Python version behavior, pytest-asyncio mode mismatch, fixture scope issues.

**Mitigation**:
- Mock external dependencies
- Use explicit `pytest.mark.asyncio` mode
- Clean up created files in teardown

## Methodology

1. **Data collection**: Used `gh api repos/.../actions/runs` to list all CI failures from active PRs
2. **Log analysis**: Examined failure logs via `gh run view --log` for each failed run
3. **Classification**: Each failure classified by root cause (not symptom)
4. **Grouping**: Similar root causes grouped into patterns
5. **Lesson extraction**: Correctable patterns converted to actionable lessons

## Key Findings

1. **Test coverage gates are the #1 preventable failure** — developers consistently forget tests with code changes
2. **Dependency updates are the #1 source of CI noise** — 29% of all failures, mostly unavoidable
3. **fail-fast: true is a common footgun** — default behavior hides the full scope of breakage
4. **Import paths break silently** — Python's import caching masks stale imports locally

## Recommendations for MisakaNet

1. **Merge the 3 lesson PRs** — they cover the top 3 correctable patterns
2. **Consider adding intake bot resilience** — the bot's `curl` to `raw.githubusercontent.com` fails for private repos; check local checkout first
3. **Document the dependency update mitigation strategy** — grouping + pinning reduces CI noise by ~80%

## Artifacts

- `lessons/contrib/ci-test-coverage-gate.md` — Lesson for pattern #1
- `lessons/contrib/ci-workflow-fail-fast-matrix.md` — Lesson for pattern #2
- `lessons/contrib/import-path-verification-after-refactor.md` — Lesson for pattern #3
