# Compatibility

MisakaNet's DSH plugin declares which `@deepseek-ai/dsh` releases it is tested against in
`package.json` (`dsh.compatibility.dshReleases`). This page records **what was actually verified**, on
which host build, by what method — and what was not. A declaration without the measurement behind it is
the kind of claim this repository removes rather than adds.

Declared today: **`0.1.5-rc.1`**, **`0.1.7-rc.2`** and **`0.2.0-rc.2`** — compatible.

## Verified

| dsh release | Declared | Disposable-profile install → uninstall | Live tool call |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1.5-rc.1` | compatible | ✅ install OK → `dsh.profile.bundles` gains `misakanet` → remove OK → bundles back to the two official ones (verified 2026-09-30) | covered by CI, not here (see below) |
| `0.1.7-rc.2` | compatible | ✅ install OK → bundles gain `misakanet` → remove OK → back to the two official ones (verified 2026-09-30) | covered by CI, not here |
| `0.2.0-rc.2` | compatible | ✅ install OK → bundles gain `misakanet` → remove OK → back to the two official ones (verified 2026-09-30) | covered by CI, not here |

The install rows are real profile installs, not manifest reads — one disposable `DSH_HOME` per line, each
run through `add` **and** `remove`:

```sh
export npm_config_cache=/tmp/npm-cache-dsh
for V in 0.1.5-rc.1 0.1.7-rc.2 0.2.0-rc.2; do
  export DSH_HOME=/tmp/dsh-home-$V        # the real ~/.dsh is never touched
  npx -y "@deepseek-ai/dsh@$V" plugin --profile web add misakanet
  python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/package.json'))['dsh']['profile']['bundles'])"
  # ['@deepseek-ai/dsh-base', '@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app', 'misakanet']
  npx -y "@deepseek-ai/dsh@$V" plugin --profile web remove misakanet
  # back to ['@deepseek-ai/dsh-base', '@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app'], dependencies: none
done
```

The install resolves the published `misakanet` from npm, so the row is evidence about the **bundle**
(which is what compatibility is about), not about the working tree. `dsh --version` on the machine that
produced the `0.2.0-rc.2` row is `0.2.0-rc.2`; the two `0.1.x` rows were produced by
`npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@<version>`, which is the same binary the host ships.

What is deliberately **not** claimed:

* **A live tool call.** This sandbox cannot reach `https://misakanet.org/mcp` (`fetch failed`), so the
  rows prove the profile composes and the row is mounted; they do not prove a `misakanet_search` round
  trip. That is what `.github/workflows/install-smoke.yml` probes daily from CI
  (`scripts/install_smoke.py npm-form`, `git-stdio`, `setup-installer`), against the same endpoint the
  bundle declares.
* **Any other release.** Add a row to both this table and `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` only after the
  same add → remove run on that release; the test below keeps the two lists identical.

## The optional peer, and why its range is written the long way

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` is an **optional peer**: `index.js` resolves it at runtime with a dynamic
import and, when it is absent, returns quietly instead of failing profile boot (an npm skill-only install
has no reason to carry DSH's own client). The peer range is therefore advisory — but it is still read by
people and by pnpm, and it has to agree with what we declare.

Measured 2026-09-30, before this change:

| | value |
| --- | --- |
| host installed | `dsh 0.2.0-rc.2` |
| the client that host ships | `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client 0.2.0-rc.2` |
| MisakaNet's declared peer range | `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0` |

The host line this package was installed on sat **outside its own declared range**. The first attempt at a
fix widened the bound to `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.3.0`, which *still* excludes it — npm only admits a pre-release
version into a comparator set that names a pre-release with the **same major.minor.patch**, so no upper
bound can rescue a pre-release; each line has to be named. That is why the declaration is a disjunction,
one clause per verified line:

```
>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.7-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.2.0-rc.1 <0.3.0
```

The last clause adds the 0.2.0 line (stable `0.2.x` and its pre-releases); the middle two exist purely
because `0.1.5-rc.1` and `0.1.7-rc.2` are pre-releases npm will not admit any other way. The 9×3 table of
npm's own answers is pinned in `tests/test_dsh_plugin_surface.py::test_the_prerelease_rule_matches_npm_semver`,
and `test_every_declared_release_is_inside_the_optional_peer_range` fails for every spelling tried before
this one (the original single clause, and the `<0.3.0` widening) — the contradiction cannot come back
silently, and a new declared line that is not named here fails the test rather than shipping.

## How to re-verify after a host bump

1. `DSH_HOME=$(mktemp -d) dsh plugin --profile web add misakanet` on the new host line;
2. check `dsh.profile.bundles` gained `misakanet`, then `remove` it and check it is gone;
3. update this table **and** the manifest in the same change — the test above keeps them in step;
4. leave the live-call column to CI, which reaches the endpoint this sandbox cannot.
