# Makefile — developer entry points. Every path referenced below must exist in this repository.
#
# Where these three things actually deploy (deployment table in `docs/agents/repo-operations.md`):
#   * main worker `misakanet-register-proxy` (serves `/mcp` and `/api`)
#       → push to main → `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml`
#         (`npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.toml`, run from `workers/`)
#   * site `misakanet-web` (assets = `docs/`)
#       → Cloudflare **Workers Builds** (Git integration) fires on every push to main. The site
#         config is the **root** `wrangler.jsonc`, kept for local preview and emergency use only
#         (`npm run deploy`). The `web/` directory this file used to `cd` into was **deleted on
#         2026-08-31 by 739cae4d9** ("slim repo — … drop web/ shell"), so `deploy-web` was the
#         residue of that removal — not a target for a directory that never existed.
#   * `email-register` worker
#       → `make deploy-email` (= `npm run deploy:email`), the only path this file still owns: no CI
#         workflow deploys it.
#
# ⚠️  `make deploy-*` is a LOCAL → PRODUCTION path (audit A10,
#     `docs/reviews/2026-08-30-dual-axis-review.md`): `wrangler deploy` runs straight from a
#     developer's checkout with no PR, no review and no CI gate in between. Merged changes never
#     need it — the two routes above already deploy them. No approval mechanism belongs here; the
#     aggregate `deploy` target merely warns before it starts. The same dead paths were fixed on the
#     npm side in #2150 (`deploy:web` deleted, `deploy:api` repointed at `wrangler.toml`); the
#     Makefile kept the same two stale references until this change.
#
# `tests/test_makefile_targets_resolve.py` keeps every path below resolvable. It is not a vacuous
# assertion: it fails on exactly the two references this file used to carry (`cd web`,
# `--config wrangler.api.jsonc`).
