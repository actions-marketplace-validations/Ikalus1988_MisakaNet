"""Generated lesson/topic page invariants (2026-09-12).

Background — what these tests prevent
-------------------------------------
`scripts/build_lesson_pages.py` existed but nothing ran it: one hand-run left the
site serving 205 lesson pages for 378 lessons, 88 pages for titles that no longer
existed, and topic pages whose counts froze at generation time
(`docs/topics/contrib` advertised "176 verified failure lessons" while the index
held 330). Three properties have to hold for a generator to be safe to run in a
loop, and each one is a real bug that was present:

1. **Idempotent** — a second run over its own output changes nothing.
2. **It owns its output** — pages it stops generating are pruned, but only pages
   it generated (never a hand-written file that happens to sit in the tree).
3. **It matches the index** — every page on disk equals what the current
   `data/lessons.json` would produce (the gate the daily job and docs.yml use).
