"""A lesson pull request must be complete, not merely correct.

Three pull requests in one afternoon were complete, well-written lessons that would have merged
cleanly and joined nothing. Two facts the repository already knew, and neither was enforced:

* **Location.** `lessons/` holds 389 lessons in `contrib/`, 14 in `core/`, and three files directly
  under `lessons/` — `TEMPLATE.md`, `LESSON_QUALITY_SCORING.md`, `README.md` — none of them
  lessons. `ACTIVE_LESSON_SUBDIRS` has been in `lesson_gate.py` since the corpus was split and every
  *discovery* path filters on it, so a lesson placed outside those directories is invisible: it
  passes every content rule and `update_lessons_json.py` never reads it.

* **Generated output.** `data/lessons.json`, `docs/data/lessons.json`, `docs/data/lessons-lite.json`
  and every lesson page are generated from `lessons/`. A pull request that adds a lesson without
  re-running the generators is **incomplete** rather than wrong, and incompleteness is the one thing
  no other check reported. The symptom arrived days later as a conflict with the next lesson pull
  request, which is how "add a lesson" learned to cost a round trip.

Both rules exist so the failure a contributor meets is one they can fix themselves, stated as a
command, at the moment they push — not a merge conflict three days later that nobody can explain.

**Why the generator half runs in a worktree.** The check is "run the generators, then look at the
diff". Running that here would rewrite the published files, and `tests/conftest.py` fails any test
that touches them — by size and mtime, so writing and restoring is not a way out either, and its
message says so by name. A throwaway worktree is the honest way to run a real write path: the
repository under test is not the repository being modified.

# A lesson that satisfies every content rule

## Problem

The content here is deliberately valid: the body is long enough, the frontmatter is complete, and
the domain is allowed. Whatever fails below fails for a reason that has nothing to do with quality.

## Root Cause

Placement and generated output are part of the contract, and neither is about whether the lesson is
any good. A lesson in a directory nothing reads is not in the corpus however well written it is, and
a lesson whose index has not been regenerated is not searchable either.

## Solution

Put the file in `lessons/contrib/`, then run `scripts/update_lessons_json.py` and
`scripts/build_lesson_pages.py` and commit what they write.

## Verification

`python3 scripts/lesson_gate.py` reports the location with the `git mv` to run, and re-running the
generators produces a diff naming every file the pull request failed to carry.
