"""Two gates that only failed on *somebody else's machine* (#2001).

The issue behind these is the shape this repository keeps hitting: a check whose verdict depends on the
environment it runs in, so it passes where CI runs and fails where users are.

1. **The one-line installer could not download at all without `curl`.** `bootstrap.sh` defined
   `fetch()` for curl *or* wget and then called `curl` directly in the download loop — the helper was
   dead code, so on a wget-only machine every mirror "failed" while the script held the function that
   would have worked. (The macOS half of the same defect — a bare `timeout`, which GNU ships and macOS
   does not — was fixed earlier and is pinned here too.)
2. **The merge-conflict fixture assumed the base branch is `master` or `main`.**
   `git switch -q master || git switch -q main` dies with `fatal: invalid reference: main` on a machine
   with `init.defaultBranch=dev`, before any conflict exists, and the benchmark reports "setup failed"
   for an environment reason. Measured 2026-09-25: it now works under `dev`, `trunk`, `main` and
   `master`, and the test runs all four rather than trusting one.

Note on naming: the issue proposes `tests/test_issue_2001_environment_gates.py` and PR #2002 carries a
version of it, still open and conflicted. This file is deliberately separate so a later merge of that PR
does not leave two copies of the same assertions.
