"""Contract tests for the MisakaNet dsh bundle declaration (PR #1484 review).

Guards the packaging contract that the dsh.so / MCP-registry verification and
`dsh plugin` rely on:

* package.json declares ``dsh.bundle.patch`` pointing at ``cordis.patch.yml``
  and ships the patch in its npm ``files`` whitelist;
* the patch contains exactly one insert row (id ``misakanet-mcp``) whose
  config is a valid Streamable HTTP declaration (serverName matching
  ^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}$, url https://misakanet.org/mcp, failOnStartupError
  false). It used to be a stdio declaration for the repo's python server, which
  only exists in git+ checkouts: every npm install therefore mounted a
  disconnected row with no tools (issue #1734);
* the patch row and index.js's ``DEFAULT_MCP_CONFIG`` agree, so a profile gets
  the same declaration whether or not the row's config is applied;
* the row id is unique across the repo's **tracked** files (no double-insert drift) — a filesystem
  walk reads nested copies too (git worktrees, a pnpm store, a test DSH home with
  ``node_modules/misakanet/``) and goes red for reasons that are not about this contract;
* **the patch never names a protected ``@deepseek-ai/*`` component** — DSH STORE
  hard-blocks that as ``SUBMISSION_PATCH_PROTECTED`` and rates the listing
  ``route: blocked``. Our own test asserted the opposite until 2026-09-12, which
  is exactly how the violation survived (see below).
