"""The intake bot's failure mode: it ran 21,732 times and posted nothing (#1825).

`intake-bot-demo.yml` exists to answer "your CI failed — someone has hit this before, here is how
they fixed it". It never posted a single comment. Two independent defects, both of which turn a real
result into silence:

1. `ARGS="--json --source $X …"` was expanded **unquoted** into `python3 $SCRIPT $ARGS`. `--error`
   carries a multi-line excerpt of the failing job's log, so word splitting handed argparse
   `--error` plus a pile of unrecognised positionals → exit 2 → and `2>/dev/null ||` replaced the
   reason with `{"decision":"error","reason":"script failed"}`. The comment step skips unknown
   decisions, the step exited 0, and the run went **green**.
2. When `workflow_run.pull_requests` was empty (a run GitHub does not associate with a PR), the
   comment step logged at `info` and returned — nothing posted, nothing wrong-looking.

These are structural assertions about the action's shell and script, because the defects are exactly
structural: the value is passed either as one argv element or as many, and a failure is either
reported or swallowed. A behavioural test of the YAML would mean running Actions.
