"""`docs/benchmarks/` was allowed to double every month, and nothing ever read the old copies.

Measured 2026-10-06
-------------------
`docs/benchmarks/` held eleven weekly snapshots totalling 13.2 MB, of which ten were
`benchmark-YYYY-MM-DD.json` and one `latest.json`. The directory gained ~2 MB a week and had
roughly doubled every month since 2026-08-28.

The size is not the interesting part. The interesting part is that **each dated snapshot is a
byte-for-byte copy of `latest.json` as it stood on that date**:

    benchmark-2026-09-28.json   1,891,265 bytes
    latest.json                 1,891,265 bytes

`benchmark-workers-ai.yml` makes that copy (`cp docs/benchmarks/latest.json
"docs/benchmarks/benchmark-$TS.json"`), and `scripts/benchmark_workers_ai.py` writes a
*cumulative* file — its resume cache is keyed on `(model, scenario[:80], condition)` and every
run is appended, never replaced. So the snapshots were never independent evidence; each is a
suffix-preserving copy of a file that already contains every run to date. They doubled the bytes
without adding a single measurement.

And nothing read them. `README.md`, `README.ja.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` all link
`latest.json`; `tests/test_benchmark_claims.py` reads `latest.json`; no document links a dated
snapshot. The two mentions in `lessons/contrib/` are `--output` arguments in commands that
*create* the file, not reads of it.

What this gate holds
--------------------
1. **The directory is pruned.** At most `KEEP` dated snapshots may exist. This is the invariant
   that actually stops the growth, and it is the half that fails if someone adds a file by hand.
2. **The workflow keeps pruning.** `.github/workflows/benchmark-workers-ai.yml` must still carry
   the retention step. Without this half, (1) holds until the next Monday's run adds a fifth file
   and nothing deletes it — the directory would be right on the day of the commit and silently
   growing again by the next one. That is the same shape as
   `tests/test_stdio_stdout_is_only_json.py`, which pins a property of the code rather than of one
   run's output.

Scope: this only bounds *future* growth. Pruning a path that is already committed cannot make an
existing clone smaller — the blob is in the pack, and only a history rewrite can remove it. See
`docs/maintainer/clone-size-measurement-2026-10-06.md` for the measurement.

    Found by this change's own CI run, 2026-10-06. `data/query-aliases.json` grounded the zh-en
    alias `数据库连接` → `database` in `docs/benchmarks/benchmark-2026-08-30.json`, and
    `tests/test_query_aliases.py::test_aliases_are_grounded_in_the_repository` went red the moment
    that file was pruned — correctly: that gate requires the cited file to exist, be git-tracked,
    and actually contain the quote, and after the prune it did none of the three.

    That is the shape worth preventing rather than repairing. The alias table is **generated data
    about the corpus**, and this retention policy decides which paths survive. Neither file says so
    anywhere, so the next person to cite a `benchmark-YYYY-MM-DD.json` gets a green build and a red
    suite four weeks later, with the cause two directories away from the symptom.

    `docs/benchmarks/latest.json` is the sanctioned target and is exempt here on purpose: it is the
    cumulative SSOT, it is append-only (`scripts/benchmark_workers_ai.py` keys its resume cache on
    `(model, scenario[:80], condition)` and appends, never rewrites), and this policy does not prune
    it. That is a materially different stability claim from `lessons/index.md`, which
