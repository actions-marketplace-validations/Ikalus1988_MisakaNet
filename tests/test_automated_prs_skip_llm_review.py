"""Automation must not pay a model to review its own pull requests.

Measured 2026-10-02: **15 of the last 100 pull requests** were `bot/leaderboard-watch` snapshot chores —
median gap **84 minutes** over that window (mean 121), roughly one every hour and a half. They are merged
by `scripts/ci/land_change.py` through GitHub's native auto-merge, so nobody reads them, but each one still
triggers **PR-Agent** (`Codium-ai/pr-agent`), the one paid model call in the set. Measured, not assumed:

* `./.github/actions/score-agent` is 118 lines of `gh api`, `grep`, `bc` and `date` — **no model, no API
  key** (0 matches for any provider marker);
* `zsxh1990/pr-genius` is a composite that runs `python3 -m prgenius analyze <title> --repo <repo>
  --body <body>`; this repository hands it **no model credential**, only the token it labels with, so from
  here it is not provably a model call.

So the honest saving is **one paid review per chore pull request** (about 15 % of pull requests stop paying
for PR-Agent), not three. The first version of this file said three, counting the two free analyses; the
review that caught it also found that the required-check set this file reasoned about was
not the one the ruleset actually demands.

Two things have to hold together:

* a workflow that calls a model **and** runs on pull requests must skip the automation's `bot/*` branches —
  the check is derived from each workflow's own `jobs:` (parsed as YAML), so a second model job added to a
  file that already has one, a `.yaml` extension, or a marker added later is covered rather than missed;
* the `audit` job must keep running there anyway — it is a required check, and skipping the job to save
  work would block every snapshot pull request forever.

# Known limits of the rule below, each one **measured** by a review rather than assumed — and the first
# version of this note had the direction backwards, which is worse than saying nothing:
#
#   * a model call moved into a reusable `on: workflow_call` workflow is invisible to both sides — the caller
#     carries no marker and the callee has no pull-request trigger — so it is a **miss**, not a false red
#     (`grep -rln workflow_call .github/workflows/` is empty today: future risk, not a present defect);
#   * a marker written only inside a YAML **comment** never reaches this rule, because `yaml.safe_load`
#     drops comments before the marker search runs. Also a **miss** — the opposite of what this note first
#     claimed (it said such a marker would redden);
#   * a marker at job level (e.g. `env: OPENAI_KEY`) with the call in an unmarked step **fails closed**:
#     nothing can be shown to be guarded, so the rule reddens.
#
# Every *marked* shape is covered: each marker-carrying step must carry the guard, or its job must. Both
# remaining misses need a marker the parser cannot see, and both fail in the direction of paying for a
# review — so they are written here rather than left to be discovered.
