"""The required DCO context has to be reported in a form the ruleset accepts — and never as a false green.

Measured 2026-09-25 on #2209: the head carried a green `DCO / Signed-off-by` **check run** (two of them,
after a `workflow_dispatch` re-report) and the ruleset still answered

    Repository rule violations found
    Required status check "DCO / Signed-off-by" is expected.

with `PUT /pulls/2209/merge` → 405 and `mergeable_state: blocked`. Posting the *same* verdict through the
statuses API (`POST /statuses/{sha}`, context `DCO / Signed-off-by`, state `success`) merged it immediately
(200, squash). Check suites and check runs on that PR and on a PR that had merged minutes earlier were
structurally identical, so the mechanism is not established — what is established is that the context is
satisfied by either form, and that a required context which can go unsatisfied by an invisible evaluation is
exactly the "merge ghost" this repository has been working around (see `docs/agents/repo-operations.md` §4).

So `dco-check.yml` now reports both. The risk that introduces is a **false green**, and the two rules below
are what stop it:

* the status must carry the first step's `passed` *output*, never the step's own outcome — that step
  succeeds even when the verdict is `failure` (a red check run is a report, not an error), so deriving the
  status from `steps.dco.outcome` would turn an unsigned commit into a satisfied required context;
* when there is no verdict at all (the check run could not be created), the step must warn and post nothing.
