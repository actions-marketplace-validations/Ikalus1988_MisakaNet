"""The DCO help text, the DCO auto-fix, and the token the auto-fix pushes with — one chain, three bugs.

Measured 2026-09-25 on PR #2201/#2202, in order:

1. `dco-audit` posts a failure comment whose body *contains the string* ``/fix-dco`` as instruction
   ("Same-repo PRs can also comment ``/fix-dco`` to auto-apply the sign-off.").
2. `fix-dco.yml` triggers on `contains(comment.body, '/fix-dco')` — so its own receipt ran the auto-fix
   without anyone asking.
3. The auto-fix force-pushed with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub created the new head's
   `pull_request: synchronize` runs as **held** (`action_required`, `actor=github-actions[bot]`).
   `DCO / Signed-off-by` is one of the three required checks on `main`, so the PR then sat at
   "Expected — waiting for status to be reported" for ever: the fix for a missing sign-off is what made
   the PR unmergeable. The repository already knew this shape —
   `lessons/contrib/ci-github-token-push-does-not-trigger-workflows.md` — and `auto-sync-prs.yml`
   solves it by pushing with a PAT.
4. The comment that started it all listed **no commits**: the action's comment step read
   `steps.scan.outputs.failed-commits-log` while the scan step writes `failed_commits_log`, and an
   unresolved output name is the empty string, not an error. It also printed its `\\n` separators
   literally.

This file executes the action's two shell steps against a real temporary git repository, so the receipt
is checked as rendered text rather than as a template, and it holds the push identity and trigger as
properties.
