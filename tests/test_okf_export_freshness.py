"""`data/okf/lessons.jsonl` must keep describing the corpus it claims to describe (#2185).

The file is **tracked**, and for two and a half months nothing regenerated it: last written 2026-07-07 with
194 records while the corpus grew to 411. It looked healthy from every angle a person checks — in the
repository, valid JSONL, readable by `build_sag_index.py` — and the failure only showed up in the *relation*
between the two: `data/sag.db` is built from this file, `misakanet/server/handlers/search.py` prefers SAG over
the complete BM25 path, so following the documented setup produced an index covering 47% of the corpus and
made recall **worse** than building nothing.

The rule is therefore a relation, not a number: the export must cover the canonical corpus to within
`COVERAGE_FLOOR`. A lesson added by a pull request does not trip it (the daily `update-lessons.yml` job
regenerates the export and lands it through the self-merging pull request), but "the writer stopped" or "the
file was reverted" does — which is exactly the state that sat in `main` for ten weeks.
