"""The `status` vocabulary is declared in several places, and they have drifted.

`scripts/lesson_gate.py` is the enforcer: `VALID_STATUS` is the set of values a lesson
may carry. Everything else — the writer's `--status` choices, the gate's own docstring,
`docs/trust-semantics.md`, `lessons/TEMPLATE.md` — is supposed to *restate* that set for
a human reader or a shell user. Restatements are exactly what rots, and it rotted here:

    $ python3 scripts/queue_lesson.py --status deprecated ...
    $ python3 scripts/lesson_gate.py <the file it just wrote>
    FAIL  - status must be one of ['active', 'archived', 'draft', 'published',
           'stale', 'superseded'], got 'deprecated'

The writer exited 0 and the gate exited 1. `deprecated` was only ever in the writer's
`choices=[...]` list; it has never been in `VALID_STATUS`, and no lesson in the corpus
carries it. A contributor who used the CLI exactly as its own `--help` described got a
file the repo's quality gate rejected.

The writer now derives its choices from `VALID_STATUS`, so that half cannot drift. These
tests pin the remaining three restatements, and — more importantly — assert the *direction*
that matters: anything the writer accepts, the gate accepts.
