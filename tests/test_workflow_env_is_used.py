"""An `env:` key a step declares and its script never mentions is dead configuration — and the usual
cause is a rename that only landed on one side.

That is exactly what `.github/workflows/ci-lesson-search.yml` shipped on 2026-09-21 (#1984):

```yaml
run: printf '%s\\n' "$ERROR_SIG" > /tmp/ci_error.log
env:
  ERROR_SIGNATURES: ${{ steps.context.outputs.error_signatures }}
```

An undefined shell variable expands to the empty string, so the file the intake bot read was one
newline. It answered `{"decision":"ignore","reason":"错误签名过短"}`, the comment step was skipped for
being false, and the run was **green**. A manual dispatch added in the same commit "verified" that
path in seconds — and verified nothing, which is why this gate exists: the new capability could be
triggered, and the thing it does was still impossible.

The rule reads the pair together, which is the only place the mismatch is visible: a name declared on
the step and absent from its own script. Names a *tool* consumes from the environment (`gh` reads
`GH_TOKEN`; `wrangler` reads `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) are exempt, because no script ever mentions them.
Measured on the whole repository before landing: 2 hits, both real (this one, and a dead `PR_TITLE`).
