"""The root package must stay a *discoverable* DSH plugin (issue #1677).

Background — the install that failed
------------------------------------
A DSH user ran the plugin-hub install for `ikalus1988/misakanet` and got:

    [packaging] @misaka-net/misakanet-setup: entry file missing: index.js
    (git distribution lacks build output — install the npm version or report to the author)

Nothing was missing from the plugin. The hub resolved the *repository* to a
package with `npm search repository:ikalus1988/misakanet`, and the only package
that advertised the repository was `@misaka-net/misakanet-setup` — the setup CLI,
which has no `main` and no entry file. The package that *is* the plugin
(`misakanet`, with `main: index.js` and the `dsh.bundle.patch` row) declared no
`repository` at all, so it never appeared as a candidate:

    misakanet@2.30.0                 repository: None
    @misaka-net/misakanet-setup@0.4.0 repository: git+…/Ikalus1988/MisakaNet.git   (no main)

So an agent-visible bug ("entry file missing") had a metadata cause, and the only
thing that would have caught it is a test that pins the *discoverability* facts
rather than the file contents — the file contents were always correct, which is
why the failure looked inexplicable from the repo side.

What is pinned here
-------------------
1. the plugin package advertises this repository (the field the resolution needs);
2. `main` and `dsh.bundle.patch` exist *and* ship (a declared file that is not in
   `files` is exactly what "entry file missing" describes, from the packer's side);
3. no other package in the repo can be mistaken for the plugin.
