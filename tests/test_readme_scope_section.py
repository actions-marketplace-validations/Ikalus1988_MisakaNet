"""The README's scope note — and the comic that carries it — must survive translation.

The four-panel comic makes the same promise the search contract makes: MisakaNet answers for the
failures it has indexed, and a miss returns `no_match` plus a ready-to-call intake. It landed in all
three READMEs at once, which is the kind of change that rots in two of them — the localized READMEs
have drifted apart structurally, so the same thought sits in a different neighbourhood in each (see
the placement test below, which names where each one keeps it).

What is deliberately **not** asserted here: the absence of the stale framing. `README.ja.md` still
carries the retired "Swarm Knowledge Protocol" heading and its 「サーバー不要。データベース不要。」
claim, and `README.zh-CN.md` repeats that claim in its own words. The onboarding modal no longer makes
that claim — PR #2706 landed the fix (squash `2aad28f14`, merged 2026-10-02T07:47:25Z, eighty-seven
seconds before this file's parent commit) — but the READMEs still do, so a rule like "no README claims a
local-only architecture" would redden `main` today, which is the trap #2694 fell into by pinning
`origin/main` as a positive control. Retiring that framing from the localized READMEs is its own change.
An earlier version of this docstring said that branch was *not* merged yet; an independent review checked
the merge timestamp and corrected it, which is the second time a claim in this pull request's description
was wrong while its artifact was right.

An independent review of the first version of this file found three false claims in its *description*
(not in the artifact) and four ways to walk around these assertions; the rules below are the answer to
both, and the review is linked from the pull request.
