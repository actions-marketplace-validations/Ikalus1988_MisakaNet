"""The automation output audit, tested offline against the failures it exists to catch.

Three automations looked healthy while producing nothing in September 2026, and no check anywhere
looked at the ratio of runs to output: `pr-genius-check.yml` (1,459 runs, zero comments ever — a
403 on every attempt), `intake-bot-demo.yml` (21,126 runs, 98.1% skipped, no output) and
`arch-review.yml` (active, scheduled, zero runs ever). These tests feed the audit the numbers that
were true then and assert it fails; then they feed it the numbers that are true after the fixes and
assert it passes. That pair is the point: a gate that cannot fail on a known-bad input is not a
gate.
