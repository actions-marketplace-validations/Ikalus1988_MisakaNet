"""`scripts/push_preflight.py` must catch a value revert and must not cry wolf at an edit.

Why the tool exists is in its own docstring: `gh_push_via_api.py` writes local bytes, so a working copy
that is one release behind silently reverts whatever main gained, and the branch looks internally
consistent while it does. This repository has paid for that twice — a release badge going backwards,
and an `x-release-please-version` line whose value was stale while every test stayed green because the
test asserted the annotation was *present*.

The tests here are mostly about the **negative** direction, because the failure mode of a preflight
check is not missing a revert; it is flagging a legitimate edit until somebody stops running it. A
count sentence that is *reworded* and re-registered in `sync_lesson_count.py` is the documented
workflow, and it necessarily removes the old sentence — so "a managed-shaped line disappeared" is not
evidence of anything. Only "the same wording, a different number" is.

The positive cases are read out of the repository's own files rather than written from imagination: if
the managed-line patterns stop matching the real sentences they are supposed to protect, these tests go
red instead of the gate going quiet.
