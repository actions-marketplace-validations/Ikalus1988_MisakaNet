"""A test that writes into the checkout's own data files is a defect, not a habit.

Why this file exists. Two of this repository's data files are *logs about the repository*:

* `data/search_gaps.jsonl` — the queries that returned nothing. It is the local input for "which lessons
  are missing" (`scripts/demand_board.py`), so its value depends entirely on being real user traffic.
  It had reached 278 rows whose largest entries were test queries: `quantum computing error correction`
  ×105 and `draft test lesson` ×49.
* `data/contribution_queue.jsonl` — contributions awaiting a decision. It had reached 522 rows, **520 of
  them fixtures** (`source: contract-test` 381, `mcp-agent` 134), and every one still `pending` — so
  anything reading it to ask "what is waiting for a decision" was reading test data.

Both are gitignored, which is why nobody noticed: nothing in CI, no diff, no review. The writer was
`tests/test_mcp_server.py` — a directly-runnable smoke script that drives the real submit and search
handlers, so it could not rely on a conftest fixture for isolation even if one had existed.

The fix is deliberately not "patch the constant in the offending tests": the failure was never that a
test forgot, it was that **nothing made writing into the checkout impossible**. `tests/conftest.py`
redirects both paths for the whole session, the smoke script redirects them for itself when run directly,
and the assertions below are what keeps that true.

The behavioural tests matter more than the constant checks: a fixture that redirects a *copy* of the path
while the handler keeps using the original would pass an equality check on the constant and still write
into the repository.
