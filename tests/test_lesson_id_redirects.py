"""`docs/_redirects` — the id -> slug table that makes `/lessons/<id>/` resolve.

Background. `misakanet_search` returns a lesson's frontmatter `id`, but its page lives at a title-derived
`/lessons/<slug>/`. For 111 of the 464 lessons those differ, so the documented pattern ("search, then open
the page at the URL the docs give") 404'd. The first fix (2026-09-29) wrote a stub HTML page per alias.
That worked in a browser and worked for nothing else: `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` is invisible to any
client that is not one, so `curl`, an MCP agent resolving a search hit, a feed reader and a link checker
all saw a `200` with a short HTML body. It also kept tripping GitHub's secret-scanning heuristic, because
the body embeds the slug text and ordinary lesson titles contain words like "keys" and "GC pattern".

This table is the structural fix: one line per alias, a real HTTP `301`, honoured by the platform itself.
The properties worth pinning are the ones whose loss is silent:

* **301, not the 302 default** — a slug is sticky (`plan_with_slugs` keeps a lesson on the URL it already
  has), so the old address is permanently moved. This also fails the *other* way if it ever regresses to
  302: nothing breaks, the redirect just stops being truthful, so only an explicit assertion catches it.
* **The table agrees with the corpus** — the failure mode is a table that outlives the slug map, which
  would send readers to a slug that has since been reassigned.
* **Every target is a real page** — a rule pointing at a 404 is worse than no rule.
* **No source is also a real page** — a rule shadowing a lesson would make a real page unreachable.
* **Platform limits** — Cloudflare caps a `_redirects` file at 2,000 static redirects and 1,000 characters
  per declaration. Both are checked against the real file so a corpus growth PR fails here rather than in
  production, where the symptom is a silently dropped rule.

The stub pages are still committed while the 301s are being observed on the live site, so this file also
asserts the two agree rule-for-rule. When the stubs are retired that assertion is what proves the overlap
was clean.
