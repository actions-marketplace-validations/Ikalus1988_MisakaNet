"""Reads that must see *every* element of a GitHub list have to paginate.

## Why this rule exists

This repository has now shipped the same pagination defect three times, and the third was the worst.
`per_page=100` reads one page. It is not "all of them", and on two endpoints in particular the
difference is silent:

- **check-runs** (`workers_builds_watch.py`). Real commits here carry 118–187 check-runs and the
  Workers Builds run is not always on the first page of them, so a one-page filter reported the
  commit as having no build at all — and the watcher answered "no state change", which for a *red*
  build is silence. Fixed in #2797.
- **issue comments** (`workers_builds_watch.py: last_state`). GitHub returns comments oldest-first, so
  one page yields the **oldest** 100. A tracker issue grows by one comment per state transition, so the
  newest state is exactly the one that goes missing; a stale `red` read out of a resolved transition
  gets re-reported as current, forever.

The threshold is not theoretical. Measured 2026-10-04: seven issues in this repository carry more than
100 comments and **#2020 carries 249** (also #761/762/763 at 237/230/200). The trackers here are
small — the largest is #2637 at 6 — so nothing is broken today. That is a property of the current issue
set, not of the code.

The first two survived because of a stub, not a shortage of tests: `StubGitHub` answered every list
request with the whole collection, so `per_page=100` was ignored and every test saw one complete page.
The stub now paginates. This rule is the second half of that fix.

## What it covers, and what it deliberately does not

The rule is scoped to the two endpoints where a caller needs **completeness** and truncation produces
no error:

    .../comments?per_page=N        dedup against all of them, or scan for the newest
    .../timeline?per_page=N        read the whole history
    .../check-runs?per_page=N      filter for a run that may be on any page

It deliberately does **not** cover `issues` and `pulls` reads, and that is a real judgement rather
than a convenient one. Most of those are deliberate top-N fetches — `workers_builds_watch.py:182` asks
for the 10 newest open issues carrying a label, and paginating it would answer a different question
than the one asked. A small `per_page` on a sorted list is a page size; a large one on a
completeness-required list is a bug. The two look identical to a scanner, so the scanner does not
guess: anything that genuinely needs every issue is currently rare enough to paginate at the call
site, and the ones that do not are left alone.

`ALLOWED` is a list of decisions, not of known bugs to tolerate. Each entry says what makes the site
acceptable *today* and what would change that.

    """1-indexed line numbers that are wholly prose: a comment, or inside a multi-line string.

    Tokenised rather than pattern-matched, because a line-prefix regex is wrong in the one case that
    matters here: the `#2797` docstring in `all_check_runs` explains the bug by quoting
    `` `per_page=100` ``, and only the *first* line of a docstring opens with a triple quote. Every
    continuation line looks like ordinary code, so a prefix rule either misses the prose — and then
    fires on the fix's own explanation — or has to guess at it.

    A line is prose only if it is a comment, or if a string token **spans** it. That last qualifier is
    load-bearing and was not obvious: marking every line that merely *contains* a string literal marks
    almost every line of Python, because `"GET"` and `item['number']` are strings too. Doing that hid
    two real reads — `register_issue.py:350` and `question_autopilot.py:617` — which is the failure
    this function exists to prevent, committed by the function itself.

    Token *names* rather than the `tokenize.FSTRING_*` constants, because those were added in Python
    3.12 and this repository runs a 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13 matrix. Referencing the constant directly passed
    on the interpreter it was written on and raised `AttributeError` on `test (ubuntu-latest, 3.11)` —
    which is precisely what that leg is for. `tok_name` maps whatever types the running interpreter has,
    so the 3.12-only names simply never appear on 3.11, and there a multi-line f-string is one `STRING`.

    Returns what it classified if the file does not tokenise. A syntax error elsewhere in `scripts/`

    This is not a hypothetical extension. When the rule was first written it scanned `scripts/**/*.py`
    only, and the *next* instance of the defect was found immediately afterwards in
    `pr-audit-watch.yml` — a shell workflow, outside the scope the scanner had been given. A guard
    whose boundary is drawn a directory too narrow will pass while the bug it describes sits next
    door, so the boundary is part of what has to be right.

    Widening it from `check-runs` to every paginated GitHub list endpoint was forced by the same
    argument one level down. The first version of *this* test matched only `check-runs`; the next
    sweep found the same one-page read in `pr-checks.yml` and `claim-enforcer.yml`, where it is not
    hypothetical at all — PR #2020 has 249 comments and 113 audit-report markers, **none on page
    1**, so the audit upsert could not find the report it was meant to replace.

    Matching is done per *statement* rather than per line, because the real shape is
    `gh api "url?per_page=100" \` followed by `--jq ...`, and a line-oriented scan would miss the
    flag sitting on the continuation. Writes are excluded by method, and a server-side `check_name=`
    filter is excluded because it asks a bounded question.

    `gh api --paginate` is the idiom, and this repository already uses it in `auto-merge-lessons.yml`
    for this exact endpoint, so the rule asks for a convention that is already in the codebase rather
