"""Worker config gates: the compatibility date, and the deploy that has to carry it.

Two production decisions lived in files no test looked at, and both had rotted silently by
2026-09-24:

1. ``workers/wrangler.toml`` still pinned ``compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"`` — the runtime
   semantics the Worker is compiled against, 997 days (~33 months) stale, while the other three
   configs in this repository were current. Nothing failed: production simply kept running by rules
   nobody had chosen any more, and what surfaced it was a Cloudflare zone audit, not this
   repository.
2. ``deploy-worker.yml`` triggered only on ``workers/register-proxy-sw.js``, and then PUT a
   hardcoded ``*/5 * * * *`` schedule after every deploy. So (a) a config-only fix deployed
   nothing, and (b) the config's own ``*/15`` — changed precisely to cut the 522 noise the loopback
   keepalive probe generates — was overwritten back to ``*/5`` on every deploy. Live schedule was
   ``*/5`` while ``main`` said ``*/15``.

Both rules are pure functions over parsed input so the fixtures below can prove they fire. A rule
that cannot go red is not a rule.
