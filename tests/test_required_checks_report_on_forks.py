"""Every **required** status check on `main` must be able to report on a **fork** PR.

The ruleset `main: the deterministic gates` (id 23826057) requires three contexts. A PR that cannot
produce all three sits at GitHub's "Expected — waiting for status to be reported" **forever**, no
matter how green everything else is, and nothing in the repository says so.

Measured 2026-09-25: **12 of the 14 open PRs were blocked exactly this way**, the oldest for 17 days,
and every one of them showed a *green* DCO workflow run. Two independent causes, both now pinned:

1. **A check created through the API needs a write token, and fork PRs do not get one.** `DCO /
   Signed-off-by` is not a job name — `dco-check.yml` creates it with `github.rest.checks.create`.
   Under `on: pull_request` a fork's `GITHUB_TOKEN` is read-only, so that call answered 403, the
   `catch` logged "Skipping DCO status check (fork PR permission)" and the required check was never
   reported. The rule here is therefore: a producer that creates its check through the API must
   trigger on `pull_request_target`.
2. **A filtered workflow reports nothing for the PRs it filters out.** `lesson-gate.yml` gained
   `paths:` at some point and lost its ability to be a required check; the file's own comment records
   that (#1920). The rule here is the same one: no `paths:` on a required check's producer.

Both rules are properties of the *producer*, which is why they are asserted from the workflow files
rather than remembered.
