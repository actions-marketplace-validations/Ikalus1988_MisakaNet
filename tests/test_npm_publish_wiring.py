"""Publishing to npm is automatic, and the only human step is approving the run.

The npm bundle line has a specific meaning — "the version that is on npm" — and
`tests/test_version_consistency.py` enforces that `package.json` may lag the repository release line but
never lead it. On 2026-09-20 it was at 2.30.2 while the repository and PyPI were at 2.31.0, and the cause
was structural rather than forgetfulness: **nothing wrote that line**. `misakanet-publish.yml` was
`workflow_dispatch`-only (so a release produced no publish at all), and the alignment that would have moved
`package.json` was mentioned solely inside an error message ("fix with: python3 scripts/align_versions.py
--source $TAG_VERSION") that a human had to read and act on.

The arrangement these tests pin:

* the release flow **dispatches** the publish, so a release cannot be forgotten;
* the publish run **moves** the npm line before publishing (that is the writer), and
  **records** it afterwards, so the line cannot drift back;
* the `release` environment stays on the job, so the run waits for a required reviewer — the human gate is
  kept, it is just no longer a *memory* gate;
* ordering matters in both directions: bumping after `npm publish` would publish the wrong version, and
  recording before it would claim a publish that might still fail.

Each assertion below is one of those failure modes, and `_wiring_problems` is exercised against scratch
copies so the rule cannot pass vacuously.
