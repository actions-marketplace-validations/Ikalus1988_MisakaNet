"""Lesson-count SSOT invariants (2026-09-12).

Background — the failure these tests exist to prevent
----------------------------------------------------
The first SSOT attempt (`update_lessons_json.refresh_lesson_count_markers`,
audit QW6) replaced a ``{{LESSONS_COUNT}}`` placeholder with the literal number.
That *consumes* the placeholder, so the second run matched nothing and every
managed count silently froze at its first materialization:

    README.md        "310+ failure lessons"
    ARCHITECTURE.md  "358+ .md files"
    docs/index.html  "435 indexed failure-recovery lessons"
                     (<meta description> + og:description — the copy Google and
                      social cards show)
    docs/search/…    "249 indexed failure-recovery lessons"

The replacement registry (`scripts/sync_lesson_count.py`) is idempotent: each
surface is a regex whose numeric group is re-matched on every run. Two bugs found
while building it are pinned here as well: a pattern that cannot match its own
output (so the second run reports "reworded"), and per-row writes onto a file
clobbering the earlier rows (only the last row survived on disk).
