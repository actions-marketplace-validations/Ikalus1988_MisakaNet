"""A lesson notification must not be dropped silently, and a dropped one must be visible.

`lesson-notify.yml` posts a Feishu card whose `msg_type` is `interactive`. The payload was
assembled by interpolating the issue's title and body into a JSON heredoc, and sent with
`curl -s` — no `--fail`. Both halves have to be true for a notification to be lost without a
trace, and both were:

* an issue title is attacker-chosen text, and a double quote or a backslash in it produces
  JSON that Feishu rejects with 400;
* `curl -s` without `--fail` exits 0 on a 4xx, so the 400 was invisible — the step went green
  and the card was never delivered.

Measured against a stub receiver that parses the body the way Feishu does:

    title                       receiver            as committed      with --fail
    docs: add a lesson          ACCEPTED (350 B)    exit 0, green      exit 0, green
    fix: handle "quoted" input  REJECTED           exit 0, GREEN      exit 22, red
    docs: add a backslash       REJECTED           exit 0, GREEN      exit 22, red

`jq -n --arg` fixes the payload and `--fail` fixes the silence; either alone leaves the other
half standing, so the tests below pin both. The step runs inside `.github/actions/retry/`, which
is covered by `tests/test_retry_action.py` — this file is about the payload and the exit code.

`jq` is preinstalled on the `ubuntu-latest` runner this workflow uses, and is already a dependency
of `adopt-pr.yml:86` and `fix-dco.yml:34`. Where it is absent the execution tests **skip loudly**
rather than pass: an empty payload plus `--fail` exits 22, so a missing `jq` cannot quietly turn
these green, but it must not be reported as coverage either.
