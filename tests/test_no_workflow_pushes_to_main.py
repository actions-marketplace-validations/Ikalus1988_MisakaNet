"""No workflow may push to `main`, and the two that still would are named here on purpose.

`main` carries the ruleset **"main: the deterministic gates"** (id 23826057): three required status
checks and an empty `bypass_actors`. A direct push therefore arrives without the checks GitHub
demands and is refused — `remote: - 3 of 3 required status checks are expected.` That is how five
automated writers silently stopped landing their output on 2026-09-22 (see
`docs/maintainer/automation-lands-via-pr.md`), and *silently* is the operative word: each of those
jobs only pushes when it has something to write, so the runs where nothing changed stayed green
while the runs that mattered went red in a step nobody was watching.

The mechanism that replaced them is `scripts/ci/land_change.py` — branch, pull request, required
checks, auto-merge. This file is the part of that change that does not depend on anyone
remembering it: a workflow that goes back to `git push`-ing `main` fails here, in a test that runs
on every PR, instead of failing months later in a scheduled run nobody reads.

Two exceptions are listed with the reason they are exceptions, and the reason has to survive being
read by the next person to touch them:

* `cite-lesson.yml` reacts to an issue labelled `usage` and its `git push` currently pushes
  nothing (the step before it writes no files), so it is a no-op rather than a blocked write.

Both entries are checked in both directions: an unlisted main-pusher fails, **and** a listed file
that no longer pushes to main fails too — so converting or deleting one forces the list to be
trimmed instead of quietly rotting into a lie.
