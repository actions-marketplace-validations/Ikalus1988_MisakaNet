"""Every generated file must name a generator that exists, and a consumer someone can point at.

`data/README.md` described five files out of 26, and one of the five named a generator that is **not
in this repository**: `batch_lesson_upgrade.py`. The real generator of `data/lessons.json` is
`scripts/update_lessons_json.py`, and getting that wrong is the whole subject of #1374 ("用
`misakanet-index.py` 会静默回滚线上统计") — a reader who believed the table would have gone looking
for a script that does not exist.

The other half of the problem was silence: **no row named a consumer**, which is how
`sync-data.yml` could publish `counter.json` and `lessons.json` to the `data` branch for weeks with
nothing reading them, and how `data/quality_scores.json` (a 141-lesson snapshot, taken when the corpus
was 402/141 = about a third of its current size) can sit in the tree with no live writer and no reader
without anyone noticing (#1985).

So the rule is not "the table is complete"; it is that the table cannot lie in the ways it did: a
missing row, a row for a file that is gone, or a generator path that is not in the tree.
