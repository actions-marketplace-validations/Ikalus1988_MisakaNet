        The path is built under tmp_path rather than spelled "/nonexistent/dir", because on Windows
        that is a *drive-relative* path: "\\nonexistent\\dir" on the current drive root. On the
        windows-latest runners that path exists — a sibling test's `mkdir(parents=True)` succeeds
        there and only there, and another test appends a 172-character `s.md` into it — so
        `watch_directory` walked it, found one file that fails the 200-character content filter, and
        returned `skipped`. The watcher's own behaviour for a missing directory is
        platform-independent (`error` + "directory not found"); what was not portable is the test's
        notion of "cannot exist". A path under tmp_path cannot exist on any platform.
