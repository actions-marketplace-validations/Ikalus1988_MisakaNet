"""The 97.9% of this site that cannot execute script must say so in a header.

#2683 audited the homepage and found no Content-Security-Policy. Its verdict on
adding one was deliberately cautious: `docs/index.html` carries 47 inline `on*`
handlers and an 82.9 KB inline `<script>`, and a strict policy over that markup
is not a one-line change. Blindly forcing one would break the homepage with no
test able to say so. That reasoning holds for the homepage and for the ten other
pages that run script.

It does not hold for the rest of the site. Measured on this branch, **521 of the
532 HTML pages under `docs/` contain no inline `on*` handler, no executable
inline `<script>`, and not a single `url(...)` in their inline CSS** — every
external reference on them points back at misakanet.org, or is a plain
`github.com` hyperlink. Those pages can carry `default-src 'none'` and lose
nothing, and this file is what keeps that true:

- a page that grows an inline handler *under a CSP rule* turns the gate red,
  because a policy with no `script-src` allowance would silently kill it;
- a page that grows script *outside* every CSP rule also turns the gate red,
  because that is the case this header cannot help with and must be noticed;
- deleting or loosening a rule turns the ratchet test red.

Why per-path rules and not one `/*` rule: Cloudflare's `_headers` **merges**
every matching rule and comma-joins a repeated header name, which is exactly why
the `Cache-Control` block in this file is three disjoint rules with a comment
about it. A CSP under `/*` cannot be loosened for the eleven script pages
without producing `Content-Security-Policy: a, b`. So the policy is written only
on paths that need it, and the two direction checks above are what keep the
omission honest.
