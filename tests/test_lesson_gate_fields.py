"""Structured lesson fields in the gate: `summary_plain` + `trigger` + `verify` (#1783).

Three optional fields, required of a lesson that *enters* the corpus:

* ``summary_plain`` — one plain-language sentence for a non-technical reader (≤120 chars)
* ``trigger``       — the short, matchable condition that should make an agent search
* ``verify``        — a checkable pass/fail criterion

The tiering is #1506's (strict for added files, advisory for files that already
exist); what these tests pin down is that the split holds, that the messages name the
field and point at the template, and that nothing else about the gate moved — the
existing suite (``tests/test_lesson_gate.py``) is the regression net for that.

Run: python3 -m pytest tests/test_lesson_gate_fields.py -q
