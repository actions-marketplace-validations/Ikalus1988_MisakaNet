"""A third-party script may not hold up the first paint, and its absence may not become injected markup.

Measured on `docs/index.html`, 2026-10-02, with a route-level delay on `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`:

| cdnjs delay | FCP while DOMPurify blocked | FCP with `defer` + readiness gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 ms | 464 ms | **236 ms** |
| 1000 ms | **1468 ms** | **236 ms** |

`defer` alone is not enough: a top-level `switchLang(LANG)` / `loadLessons()` / `loadVoices()` reaches
`DOMPurify.sanitize` before a deferred script has run. (An earlier version of this docstring claimed
"three of three runs threw `DOMPurify is not defined`"; an independent review could not reproduce it —
that throw is swallowed by `loadVoices`' own `try/catch` and surfaces as `voicesLoadFailed`. What it did
reproduce is `main` throwing in three places under a **poisoned payload plus an aborted CDN**, which is
the failure this gate exists to prevent.)

`interactive` is not "the script has had its chance": it means the parser is done while a deferred script
may still be **in flight** — `DOMContentLoaded` has **not** fired yet. (An earlier version of this
paragraph said the opposite; the review measured it: with the CDN held, `readyState` was `interactive` at
146 ms and `DOMContentLoaded` did not fire until 858 ms, when the script finally arrived. That gap is
exactly what made an early settle possible.) The state also spans the `DOMContentLoaded` → `load` window,
so an earlier version that settled whenever `readyState` was anything but `loading` resolved false before
DOMPurify arrived and the voices wall was never rendered. The gate now waits for `complete` — or for
`DOMContentLoaded` **and** `load`.

The failure that matters most is the quiet one: `cdnjs` is a common block-list target, and a page that
cannot sanitise must render **plain text** rather than inject what it could not sanitise. That is what the
`onMissing` arm of `whenPurifyReady` is for, and this file keeps both halves in place.
