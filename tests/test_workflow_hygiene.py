"""Workflow checks that are either dead or dishonest about what they do.

Two shapes, both found by an external review (OPEN-CODE-REVIEW-2026-10-06.md §3.4) and both of
which turned out to be something other than the one-line fix the review proposed:

* **`pr-checks.yml`'s action-pinning advisory** filtered with `grep -v '@[a-f0-9]{40}'`. The
  review was right that `{40}` is a literal in a basic regular expression, so the filter matched
  nothing — and wrong about what follows from it. Adding `-E`, as suggested, makes the filter
  *live* and makes the check worse: `[a-f0-9]` does not contain `v`, so it can only fire on a
  line that names a 40-hex SHA somewhere else, and then it drops a genuine tag pin. The filter is
  removed, and the remaining grep is fed comment-stripped input so a `uses:` in prose is not
  reported as an unpinned action.

* **`example-capture.yml`** ran `python -m pytest || true` and then gated the capture on
  `if: failure()`. The `|| true` makes the condition permanently false, so the example could
  never capture anything — and it is a file people copy, so it taught the dead pattern.
