"""Onboarding snippets must stay copy-pasteable, MCP-first (2026-09-12, #1622).

The join-welcome comment is the *first* thing a new node executes, so a stale one
costs every new arrival: until this change it asked the new node to download the
1.1 MB `data/lessons.json` and search it locally, and never mentioned the remote
MCP endpoint — even though one HTTP call does the same job in ~1s and is the same
interface they will use to contribute.

Two facts verified against production on 2026-09-12 and encoded here:

* `Origin` is **not** required — absent is 200 OK, and only an *invalid* value gets
  `403 Forbidden: invalid Origin` (AGENTS.md and the troubleshooting table said
  "缺了会失败", which sent people hunting a non-existent failure);
* the read path was metered at 5/day/IP on 2026-09-12, and shared egress IPs (corporate NAT,
  CI runners) exhausted that immediately — so the welcome hands over the `misakanet_register`
  call instead of only mentioning that it exists. The quota was retired on 2026-09-18 (anonymous
  reads are unlimited; only a per-address burst guard remains) and the reason to hand the call
  over outlived it: the token is what unlocks the **write** tools, which is the difference
  between an agent that reads this repository's memory and one that adds to it.
