"""A handoff citation must point at a handoff that exists.

The one shape with no legitimate exception.

Found in the wild (2026-10-04)
------------------------------
Two live production workflows and two live tests justified their retry budgets by citing a receipt:

    .github/workflows/deploy-freshness.yml:51  `docs/maintainer/handoff-2026-09-24.md`
                                            records ~1 request in 4 …
    .github/workflows/site-health.yml:49       the repository has the receipt for why this
                                            matters: `docs/…-09-24.md`
    tests/test_deploy_freshness.py:63          handoff-2026-09-24 measurement (~1 request in 4 …)
    tests/test_site_health_wiring.py:18        `docs/maintainer/handoff-2026-09-24.md`
                                            records ~1 request …

**That file was never committed.** The series runs 09-16 → 09-30 with no 09-24 in it, and the
figure it was cited for ("~1 request in 4 times out from a real machine") appears nowhere else in
the repository. So four load-bearing comments pointed every future debugger at a measurement that
could not be checked by anyone, including the author — the failure this repository already names in
`tests/test_deploy_freshness.py:7-9` ("a probe that reports 'fine' when it measured nothing is worse
than no probe") and `docs/maintainer/handoff-2026-09-30.md:3` (numbers must carry a source and a
measurement time).

Why this rule and not the general one
-------------------------------------
`tests/test_cited_lesson_paths_exist.py` already measured and **rejected** the broad version: "every
path in backticks in `docs/**` must exist" flags 69 absent paths across 35 documents, almost all of
them legitimate prose (history, tombstones, not-yet-produced inputs, plans), and "a gate that flags
all four is a gate that gets switched off". Measured again here for code specifically: 237 citation
sites from `.github/workflows`, `tests/` and `scripts/`, of which **15 do not resolve — and almost
all of those are deliberate fixtures** (`docs/does-not-exist.md`, `tmp_path` lesson names
invented by
`test_land_change.py`). Adopting that rule would mean an exemption table larger than the gate.

This rule is narrower on purpose, and it is narrow along the one axis where the sibling test's
exceptions do not apply:

* The subject is **the handoff series only** — a closed, curated set of 17 dated files.
* The subject is **code and maintained docs**, not dated records. A dated record naming a path
  a file
  once had is history, which the sibling test exempts for good reason. A workflow or a test is not a
  record: it is read as current truth by whoever debugs it next month, and a comment there is
  asserting a fact *now*, not remembering one.
* The claim is not "this path existed at the time" but "**here is the receipt for this number**". A
  receipt to a file that was never committed is not a receipt. There is no legitimate reading under
  which a code comment may cite a handoff as evidence and have that evidence be absent.

Measured baseline when this was added: 14 distinct handoff citations in scope, **0 unresolvable**
after the four above were corrected. The one handoff citation that still does not resolve,
`handoff-2026-09-17.md` in
`docs/maintainer/capability-inventory-automation-2026-09-18.md`, is a dated
record and is deliberately out of scope — the same exemption the sibling test applies.

A note on what this gate does *not* do: it cannot tell you whether the measurement inside a
handoff is
true, only that the receipt is there. That is the achievable half, and it is the half that was
missing.
