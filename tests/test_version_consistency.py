"""M0 safety net (audit 2026-09-05, T0.1): version-string consistency.

MisakaNet deliberately runs TWO version lines (see the "对齐" flow in
docs/maintainer/handoff-2026-09-05.md):

* registry / release line — ``server.json`` ``version`` + ``glama.json``
  ``version`` (MCP-registry listing version, bumped in lockstep per release)
* PyPI package line       — ``pyproject.toml`` + the ``packages[]`` entry with
  ``registryType: "pypi"`` inside ``server.json`` (the version actually
  published to PyPI)

Historical failure mode: a partial bump ships mismatched metadata (registry
says one version while the PyPI package entry / docs advertise another).
These tests pin the invariants so a partial bump fails CI with the actual
values instead of silently drifting.

Note: `.release-please-manifest.json` (`.` key) records the last
release-please release; it must never be *older* than the declared PyPI
version on main. JOIN.md/API.md/docs/index.html/README.md advertise
informational versions which must never claim something NEWER than the
authoritative lines (catches forward-typos; making them exactly equal is the
Milestone-2 version-source-of-truth task, not this safety net).

# ── The annotation is a writer; the *value* is a relation to the manifest ───────────────────────────
# `_writer_problems` proves every pinned file has one line release-please can rewrite. It does not check
# that the line currently carries the right number, and on 2026-09-25 that gap cost nine `test` legs,
# twice. A branch whose `docs/index.html` had been pushed as whole-file content from a checkout taken
# before the 2.35.0 release arrived with badge `v2.34.0` against a manifest of `2.35.0`:
#
#     AssertionError: site badge v2.34.0 != manifest 2.35.0      1 failed, 2459 passed
#
# `test_site_badge_matches_the_manifest` caught the badge (that is what it is for). The same stale
# checkout also held `workers/register-proxy-sw.js` — the version string every MCP client reads as the
# server version — and `scripts/misakanet_cli.py` at 2.34.0, and **nothing** could see those two: no
# rule compares them to anything. A release step that misses one leaves no trace at all, because the
# value is only wrong in relation to the manifest.
