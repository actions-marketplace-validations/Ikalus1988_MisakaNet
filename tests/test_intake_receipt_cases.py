"""Case harness for the intake → lesson receipt loop (#1528).

#1528's own acceptance rule, written by the maintainer on 2026-09-12, is:

    「验收要可判定：贴出"跑什么命令、看什么输出"的端到端演示（提交 intake → 合入 → 回执送达来源线程），
      而不是"文件多/CI 绿"」

The cases in `tests/intake_receipt_cases/` are that demo, and they are **real conversions from this
repository's history** — not invented fixtures. Each one records an intake, who reported it, and the
receipt it must produce. Run them with:

    pytest tests/test_intake_receipt_cases.py -v
    python3 scripts/intake_receipt.py --list-cases
    python3 scripts/intake_receipt.py --intake 1472

Why cases rather than unit tests of the helpers: the thing that has actually been failing is not the
string formatting, it is the *loop* — a lesson merges and the intake stays open saying nothing. Four
intakes were in exactly that state on 2026-09-21 (#1472/#1473/#1635/#1574, lessons merged days
earlier, no receipt), which is the defect this issue exists to kill. A case asserts the outcome a
reporter would see, including the two that must **not** produce a receipt.
