"""The status-code query has cost three human approvals to guesswork, so it is now tested.

`cf-diagnostics.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only and sits behind the `release` environment's required
reviewer: every mistake in it costs a person a click, and the mistakes are all the same shape —
a GraphQL field name I believed existed.

Measured 2026-09-24, in order:

1. `filter: {datetime_geq: "-24h"}` → `error parsing args: datetime_geq: not an iso8601 time`;
2. `dimensions { edgeResponseTime … }` → `unknown field "edgeResponseTime"` (#2135);
3. `dimensions { clientRequestHost … }` → `unknown field "clientRequestHost"` — and because the step
   printed the error and exited 0, run 4 reported **success** while printing an empty table.

Three strikes is a design problem, not bad luck: the query asserted a schema instead of asking for it.
The step now introspects the schema, uses the name it finds (falling back to a short candidate list,
and then to no host dimension at all), and **fails the step** on GraphQL validation errors while still
treating a 403 as a finding.

This file runs that exact script — extracted from the YAML, not copied — against a stub GraphQL
endpoint, and covers the case that matters: the stub's schema calls the host dimension something the
workflow does not hardcode.
