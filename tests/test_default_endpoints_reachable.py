"""Every default endpoint in this repository must name a domain that resolves.

`integrations/langchain/misakanet_tool.py` and `integrations/llamaindex/misakanet_tool.py`
both shipped this:

    DEFAULT_ENDPOINT = "https://misakanet.dev/api/search"
    DEFAULT_MCP_URL  = "https://misakanet.dev/mcp"

`misakanet.dev` does not resolve. Measured 2026-10-06 on this machine:

    $ getent hosts misakanet.dev
    (nothing — NO DNS)
    $ getent hosts misakanet.org
    2606:4700:3032::6815:3761 misakanet.org

Both files feed that constant straight into `urllib.request.urlopen`, and both read it
as a user-overridable default:

    default_factory=lambda: os.environ.get("MISAKANET_SEARCH_URL", DEFAULT_ENDPOINT)

So the tool worked exactly as written and returned `Search failed: <urlopen error
[Errno -2] Name or service not known>` for every query. Two further problems rode along:
the path was wrong as well as the host (`/api/search` is a 404; the public search
endpoint is `/api/lessons`, confirmed 200 JSON at the time of writing), and
`misakanet.dev` appears in 20+ tracked files.

**Why the suite was green.** `tests/test_integrations.py` patches
`urllib.request.urlopen` for the REST search path, so the constant is never resolved,
never dialled, and never checked. Every assertion passed against a URL that cannot
exist. That is the same shape as the dead `tests/dsh/` suite removed in #2920: a mock
at the boundary converts "this cannot work" into "this is tested". Mocking the network
is legitimate; mocking the network *and* asserting nothing about the address is a test
that certifies a fiction.

This gate does not make network calls — the suite has to stay runnable offline and
without credentials. It asserts the weaker property that is still decisive: a default
endpoint must name the repository's canonical host, and must use a path the worker
actually serves. The canonical host is not hardcoded here; it is read from the shipped
client (`lib/client.js`), so a future domain change updates the gate instead of
silently invalidating it.

# ── The same defect, one layer in: reading fields the response does not carry ────────
#
# Both wrappers rendered `result.get("type", "unknown")` per result. `type` is not a
# lesson field — not one of the 467 entries in `data/lessons.json` has one, and the
# live endpoint does not send one either (measured 2026-10-06, three queries, nine
# results: `type` absent from all). So the fallback fired on every result and every
# line the tool ever printed read `[unknown]`. The field that does exist on every
# lesson is `domain`.
#
# `tests/test_integrations.py` could not see this. Its payload invented a `type` field,
# so the invented field satisfied the invented read, and its assertions only checked
# that the title appeared somewhere in the output. The langchain half of that file
# additionally skips outright — no CI job installs langchain — so it has never run in
# CI at all. The check below reads the source instead of the runtime, so it covers both
# wrappers with no optional dependency and nothing to mock.
#
# **What is deliberately not asserted here.** An earlier version of this check treated
# `data/lessons.json` as the authority on which fields exist, and flagged `score` and
# `problem` as unreadable. Both are wrong conclusions, and `workers/register-proxy-sw.js`
# says why in the source:
#
#   * `problem` is filled from the D1 column first (`lesson.problem || lesson.description
#     || lesson.summary || lesson.preview`), precisely because the GitHub snapshot only
#     carries the latter two. The index file and the API response are different shapes.
#   * `score` is emitted only when it is a finite number, and on purpose: the
#     `searchLessons` fallback does not rank, so its rows have no score, and a
#     `score: 0` would read as "ranked, and the ranking is zero" — worse than absent.
#
# So a field being absent from the index says nothing about the endpoint. The one claim
# this gate can make honestly is narrower: `type` is in neither shape.

# Fields that exist in neither the index nor the API response, measured 2026-10-06.
# Kept explicit rather than derived, because deriving it from the index is what produced
# the false positives described above.
