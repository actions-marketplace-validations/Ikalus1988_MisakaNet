"""The DSH client e2e gate must keep doing the things that made it worth adding.

`tests/e2e/run_client_e2e.py` is the only check in this repository that runs the client half in a real host
and a real browser, so the ways it can quietly become useless are worth pinning:

* a scenario renamed or dropped leaves the suite green while covering less;
* a `pkill -f "<port>"` creeps back in — this repository has killed its own shell twice that way, because the
  pattern matches the invoking command line;
* the library is no longer intercepted, so the gate starts depending on the public site being reachable;
* a fresh `DSH_HOME` opens its first-run modals and mounts the composer inert, and a suite that does not handle
  both simply times out with no explanation;
* the seeded workspace record loses a field its schema requires, so the domain drops it and the composer stays
  a chooser — the failure that looked like "a fresh profile cannot create a first session";
* the runner goes back to *driving the workspace chooser*, which is what hid that rejection in the first place;
* the workflow grows a `paths:` filter on `pull_request`, which `lesson-gate.yml` already documents as the way
  a gate goes missing on the PRs it skips (GitHub leaves them at "Expected" forever).
