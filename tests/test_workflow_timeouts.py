"""Every job needs a bound, and a bound equal to the platform default is not one.

54 of the 94 jobs in this repository had no `timeout-minutes`, so they ran to GitHub's default of
360 minutes. The external review that flagged it is cited in `docs/maintainer/handoff-2026-10-07.md`
§1; the argument for adding them is in the commit that did, and it is repeated here because it
decides what the number has to be:

* the cost of no bound is not only six hours of runner time. `audit` and `gate` are required by
  ruleset 23826057, which has no bypass actors, so a hung required check means a contributor waits
  up to six hours to learn that their pull request will not pass;
* the cost of a bound that is too low is a false red on a required check, which is the outcome
  that gets a rule deleted rather than fixed — `tests/test_automated_prs_skip_llm_review.py`
  records three separate rules that were each broken that way;
* those costs are not symmetric, so the added bound is 30 minutes against a longest observed
  legitimate job of 7.5 minutes, and the jobs that already had one keep theirs.

**The upper bound is the interesting rule, and its first form was wrong.** The draft asked that no
bound exceed 60 minutes, to stop someone satisfying the check with a value that does nothing.
That reddens `benchmark-workers-ai.yml`'s 90 minutes, which is set deliberately because the job
runs AI benchmarks, and a rule that punishes a considered choice is a rule that gets deleted. The
draft also asked every bound to exceed the slowest job in the repository, which is wrong twice
over: it constrains a job that finishes in seconds by an unrelated slow one, and it is a
repository-wide constant standing in for a per-job fact.

What survives is narrower and is the actual failure mode: **a bound equal to the platform default
is indistinguishable from no bound at all.** That is the one value that cannot be defended, and
`codeql.yml` was carrying it.

#: make a per-job bound checkable at all. A job with no completed run in the window is deliberately
#: absent rather than estimated.
#:
#: `pr-agent` needs a note. Its 15-minute bound *fired* within an hour of landing, on a run where
#: the upstream `openai/minimax-M3` call hung: `litellm.Timeout … time taken=362.47 seconds`, and
#: the job was cut at 15:00. That 15.2-minute figure is a hang the bound caught, not a duration
#: the job needs, so it is not what the row records. Its two healthy runs are 3m15s and a review
#: that completed 6.4 minutes in; the slowest of those is the number a bound must clear.
#:
#: `codeql.yml`'s `analyze` is a matrix, so its 24 samples are 12 runs of each of its two
