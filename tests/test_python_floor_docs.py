"""A document that tells you to run the test suite must state the version the *suite* needs.

`pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.10"` and the ruff target is `py310` — both true of the
**library**. The **suite** needs 3.11+, because `tests/` imports `tomllib`, which is stdlib only from 3.11. So
a contributor on 3.10 could follow the environment line in `docs/agents/repo-operations.md` ("Python ≥ 3.10"),
`pip install -r requirements.txt` successfully, and then watch `pytest tests/` exit during **collection** with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tomllib'` — a message that reads like a broken checkout rather than a
version floor. That is the same failure `pr-checks.yml` had (measured 2026-09-25: the auditor pinned 3.10 and
every PR carried a red auditor while blaming "the test suite").

Two rules, and they are about the *relation* rather than a number:

* a document that names a Python floor **and** tells the reader to run the suite must also name the suite's
  floor — which is **derived** by `tests/test_workflow_python_floors.py`, so the number cannot drift away from
  CI;
* no document may pair a *lower* version with a suite instruction (a stale "Python 3.9+" next to
  `pytest tests/` is worse than no number at all).

`README.md` states a floor for *using* the library and never tells anyone to run the suite, so it is left
alone — the rule is deliberately about the combination.
