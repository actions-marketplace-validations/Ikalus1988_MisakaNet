"""The integration docs are the product's front door; three kinds of rot are gated here.

1. **`mcpServers` in the wrong file.** Claude Code reads MCP servers from `~/.claude.json`
   (local/user scope) and `.mcp.json` at the project root (project scope). `settings.json` holds
   hooks, permissions and env. Five documents — including the canonical `docs/mcp.md` — told readers
   to put `mcpServers` in `settings.json`, which contradicts both the official scope table
   (https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) and this repository's own installer, which
   writes `~/.claude.json`. The symptom for a reader is an empty `/mcp` panel and no error.
2. **Agent lists that drift from capability.** The README describes which agents the installer
   manages; the installer's real target list is the `AGENTS` array in
   `packages/misakanet-setup/bin/misakanet-setup.mjs` (and its `--only` help text). A previous README
   sentence put Claude Code and Codex under "(MCP)" while calling only Hermes/OpenClaw/codewhale
   installer-managed — the opposite of the truth.
3. **Links inside `docs/integrations/`.** `status.md` pointed at its own evidence file with a path
   that did not exist (`agent-integration-matrix-2026-09-16.md` instead of
   `../field-reports/agent-integration-matrix-2026-09-16.md`), and the index linked
   `continue/README.md` when the file is `continue.md`. A reader following the "evidence" link got a
   404, which is worse than no link: it is the one place the table asks you to verify it.
