    Three earlier versions of this rule were beaten, each worth remembering: a count of assignments
    (defeated by deleting one write and adding two dummies elsewhere); a ±window around each branch's
    copy (defeated by reordering that copy, which slid another branch's write into the window); and
    whole-line-only comment stripping (defeated by a *trailing* comment containing the very text the rule
    looks for). Braces do not move when copy does, strings are understood before comments are stripped,
    and depth keeps a nested conditional from standing in for the statement itself.

    One limit remains, and it is not a parsing gap: **the rules check shape, not meaning.** A review
    demonstrated the class with three variants that a text rule cannot reach — reassigning `status` to a
    detached node (`const` → `let` plus `document.createElement`), writing and then clearing the same
    field, and writing the literal `"rawQ"` instead of the query. Each leaves the page announcing
    nothing while this file stays green, and each depends on **runtime values or ordering** rather than
    syntax, so no amount of regex would close them.

    Everything syntactic that was tried is caught, including two probes from the final round: a condition
    and its statement on separate lines, and a property chain (`foo.status.textContent = …`, which is not
    the live region). The regex-literal concern from an earlier round turned out to be **already
    closed**: the guard before a write inside `/…/` is `/`, which is neither empty nor `if (status)`.

    That is the honest stopping point for a text rule, and the reason the behavioural proof belongs in
    the browser suite (`tests/e2e/run_client_e2e.py` already drives a real Chromium): "search a hit, a
    miss, then clear — what did the live region say?" is a question this file can only approximate.
