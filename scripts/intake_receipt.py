"""Intake → lesson conversion receipts (issue #1528), and the case harness that judges them.

Why this exists
---------------
Closing an intake with a receipt has been a **manual** step, and it shows: on 2026-09-21 four
intakes (#1472/#1473/#1635/#1574) had had their lessons merged days earlier and were still open
with nothing said, so from the reporter's side the report looked ignored. The maintainer's own SOP
(`docs/maintainer/intake-triage.md` §3) calls the receipt an iron rule — a rule that depends on
someone remembering is not a mechanism.

Two of #1528's three acceptance criteria are answered here:

* AC1 "track source + intake issue id through lesson-ification" — the link already exists, in the
  lesson's own frontmatter (`source: "intake-1130"`, `provenance.issue: "#1130"`). This resolves it
  tolerantly, because contributors write it in several shapes.
* AC2/AC3 "promotion → emit a receipt pointing at the lesson, including evidence_level" — that is
  `compose()` + `render()`.

The channel for a reporter *with* a GitHub thread is a comment. An anonymous MCP reporter has no
thread to be notified in, which is #1605's story: the fix shipped in 30 minutes and its reporter
could never learn that. For them the receipt travels on the channel they already use — re-submitting
the same problem text, which already returns the maintainer's answer for questions — so `compose()`
also produces the `mcp` payload `{resolved, issue, lesson, evidence_level}`.

This file is deliberately offline and read-only: it composes and prints. Posting is a separate,
explicit act (`--post` is not implemented yet; wiring it is the remaining half of #1528), and the
cases under `tests/intake_receipt_cases/` are what make that wiring judgeable — each one is a real
conversion from this repository's history, with the receipt it must produce.

    python3 scripts/intake_receipt.py --intake 1618 --json     # the structured payload
    python3 scripts/intake_receipt.py --list-cases             # what the harness covers

    A bare number is deliberately **not** a citation. The first version of this matcher accepted one,
    and on 2026-09-22 that made three of the four "done but not said" intakes artifacts: ``#1940``
    matched the digits of the forum thread ``bbs.gongkong.com/d/201302/481940``, ``#2015`` matched the
    year in ``samsaffron.com/archive/2015/…``, and ``#2011`` matched inside the date ``202011``.

    A detector whose output is three-quarters artifacts is worse than none: this one would have had us
    close three open intakes and tell their reporters the work was done. Requiring the *shape* costs
    at most a false negative we do not have (``…/issues/1920`` in another repository is not our intake
    #1920) and removes the whole class.
