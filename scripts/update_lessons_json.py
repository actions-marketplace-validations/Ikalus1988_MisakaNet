# generator does emit it top-level (411/411), and the fallback code beside the
# plain fields (`frontmatterField(lesson.frontmatter, …)`) cannot rescue them

# ── writing the corpus ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every write below replaces a *published* file: the 1.4 MB authoritative index and the two copies
# Cloudflare Workers Builds serves from `docs/`. `Path.write_text` / `Path.write_bytes` open the
# destination with O_TRUNC, so the file a reader is using is already gone by the time the first byte
# is written — a `kill -9`, a full disk or any exception between open and close leaves
# `data/lessons.json` half a JSON document, and the next thing to read it is the site's search page or
# `scripts/check_docs_data_copy.py`. Measured 2026-10-07 in this repository, on a different file: an
# unrelated edit opened a 255-line document with `open(path, "wb")` and raised before writing, which
# truncated it to zero bytes; only git had a copy.
#
# So: write a sibling temp file, then `os.replace`. The rename is atomic within a filesystem, which
# is the whole guarantee — a reader sees either the old bytes or the new ones, never a prefix. The
# temp file must be a *sibling* for that to hold, which is also why this is not `NamedTemporaryFile`
# in the system temp dir (which is very often a different filesystem, where `os.replace` raises
# EXDEV instead of renaming).
#
# This is the same pattern as `misakanet/profile.py::_save`, the repository's other JSON writer that
# must not leave a half-written file; two details that file does not need and this one does, because
# the destination is tracked and world-readable rather than a private per-machine file: the temp
# file's 0600 mode is copied onto the destination, and the directory is fsynced as well as the file.

    the write and the rename must not leave the debris either).

    The temp file is written in **text mode on purpose**. `newline=None` means the OS translates
