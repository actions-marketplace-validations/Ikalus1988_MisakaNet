"""What would this push actually change — and what would it silently revert?

Why this exists. `scripts/gh_push_via_api.py` is a **content** pusher: it writes the local bytes of
the files you name onto a branch based on the current remote tip. That is the right tool when the git
wire protocol is unusable (it usually is from this network), and it has one failure mode that has now
bitten this repository twice:

    if your working copy of a file is older than the remote's, every line the remote gained since is
    silently reverted — and no test on the branch can see it, because the branch is internally
    consistent.

Both incidents are recorded. A release branch carried `docs/index.html` from *before* the release, so
the badge reverted from 2.35.0 to 2.34.0 and only `test_version_consistency.py` noticed. Separately,
`workers/register-proxy-sw.js` was one release behind on a line carrying an `x-release-please-version`
annotation, and **nothing** reddened: the test asserted the annotation was present, not that its value
was current. The team's answer was a manual ritual — "diff every file you are about to push against
`main` first" — which is a good rule and a bad mechanism, because it is exactly the kind of step that
is skipped when the network is flaky and the push is urgent.

So this script is that ritual, with the judgement left where it belongs. It does **not** try to decide
whether a removal is intended; it cannot know. It shows you the removals, marks the ones that look like
a tracked artifact's managed line, and decides only the two things that are unambiguous:

  * a file you named is **identical** to `main`  -> you are about to push nothing (stale branch, wrong
    file); a real problem, exit 1
  * a file you named is **absent locally**       -> the push would delete it from main, exit 1
  * `--all`: something on `main` is **missing from this checkout** -> the checkout is behind, and every
    push from it risks a revert; exit 1

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/push_preflight.py <path> [<path> ...]     # the files you intend to push
    python3 scripts/push_preflight.py --all                   # whole-tree drift map vs main
    python3 scripts/push_preflight.py --all --json            # machine-readable

Two costs, deliberately: the remote tree arrives in **one** API call for `--all` (2 with the commit
lookup), and one more per *named* file for the reverse diff. `--all` never fetches file contents.

Token resolution matches `gh_push_via_api.py`: `$GITHUB_TOKEN` / `$GH_TOKEN`, then the first
`github.com` entry in `~/.git-credentials`. The token is never printed.

`git ls-files` is read with `-c core.quotepath=false`. Without it git escapes non-ASCII paths as octal
inside quotes, and every CJK lesson filename in this repository turns into a fabricated "only local"
finding — a mistake worth naming, because it was made while writing this script.
