"""Remove the duplicate entries `release-please` puts in the newest release section.

`release-please` builds a release's notes from the conventional commits between two tags. When a PR reaches
`main` through a **merge commit whose message also carries the PR title** (GitHub fills the body with it by
default), the branch commit and the merge commit both look conventional — so the change is listed twice.
Measured 2026-09-25 on the 2.35.0 release PR:

    137 bullet lines, 104 distinct entries, 33 of them listed twice

`tests/test_changelog_shape.py` refuses to release in that state, and it is right to: the release notes are
the one page a user reads to decide whether to upgrade, and an entry that appears twice reads as two changes.
The *cause* is fixed (every merge path squashes now — pinned by `test_every_merge_path_squashes`), but the
damage from the merges that already happened is in the commit range until the release that carries it is
tagged, and `release-please` regenerates the section on every push to `main`. So the repair has to happen
where the section is generated, on every run, or it is undone by the next push — which is why
`release-please.yml` calls this script after the action instead of a human editing the release PR by hand.

Which copy is kept: the one carrying the **most reference groups**, because that is the copy with the PR
link (`([#2121](…))`) rather than only the bare commit link. Ties keep the first occurrence. Order is the
generator's; this script only removes lines.

    python3 scripts/dedupe_release_entries.py --check   # exit 1 if the newest section has duplicates
    python3 scripts/dedupe_release_entries.py           # rewrite in place, print what it removed
