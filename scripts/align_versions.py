"""Version alignment for MisakaNet's multi-channel version lines (audit T2.1).

MisakaNet deliberately runs THREE version channels with independent cadence
(see docs/maintenance.md → 版本通道):

* registry line  — server.json/glama.json ``version`` (MCP-registry listing
  version; currently 2.29.x). Bumped together with the repo release tags, the
  docs that advertise them (API.md header, JOIN.md) and the agent-discovery
  cards under docs/.well-known/ (they declare the *server* version; their
  ``supportedInterfaces.protocolVersion`` is a different fact and is left alone).
* source line    — pyproject.toml + package.json + .release-please-manifest
  (the repo's own "next release" line, currently 2.23.x). package.json and
  the manifest must match; pyproject may lag it by design (bumped when the
  PyPI package is actually published).
* pypi channel   — the version actually on pypi.org (currently far behind,
  2.18.0): publishes have not run since; server.json's pypi packages[] entry
  tracks the source line (== pyproject) as the *next* pypi version.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/align_versions.py --check
      Print every declared version + pass/fail against the policy below.
      Exit 1 when a policy invariant breaks (CI / release gate).
  python3 scripts/align_versions.py --source 2.24.0
      Bump the repo release line: pyproject.toml, package.json,
      .release-please-manifest.json ("."), README npm claims.
  python3 scripts/align_versions.py --registry 2.28.0
      Bump the registry line: server.json + glama.json + API.md + JOIN.md
      + the docs/.well-known cards' server version.

Policy invariants (mirrored by tests/test_version_consistency.py):
  R1 registry pair equal:        server.json.version == glama.json.version
  R2 npm-bundle never ahead:     package.json <= manifest "."  (npm bundle
                                 line lags the repo release line)

There is deliberately **no floor** on the npm bundle line: moving backwards is
reported by `--check` as an advisory and never fails, because a deliberate
rollback and a typo look identical from the version number alone
(`npm_bundle_floor`, 2026-09-29).
  R3 pypi-source equal:          server.json pypi-package.version == pyproject
  R4 lag allowed:                pyproject <= manifest
  R5 docs never ahead:           API.md / JOIN.md / README claims
  R6 cards equal registry:       docs/.well-known/*.json server version
                                 <= max(registry, manifest)
