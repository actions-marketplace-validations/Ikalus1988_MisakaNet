"""A red site build must not be invisible (#2136).

`Workers Builds: misakanet-web` is Cloudflare's Git integration deploying `docs/` to misakanet.org. It
is **not** one of the three checks the ruleset requires (`DCO / Signed-off-by`, `test (ubuntu-latest,
3.11)`, `gate`), and its check-run carries no summary, no annotation and no log beyond a dashboard
link — so it can be red on every commit for a day while merges keep landing and the site keeps not
updating. That is not hypothetical: measured 2026-09-24, the live site was still byte-identical to
`7fcebbf2a` (2026-09-23T17:29Z) while ~25 commits had landed on top of it, and the only place the
failure was visible at all was a red check-run nobody was required to look at.

There are two ways to fix that, and they cost very different things:

* **make the check required** — every merge is blocked until the site build is green, including the
  merge that *fixes* the build. That trades a silent failure for a stuck repository.
* **make it loud** — one issue, in the place a maintainer actually looks. No merge is ever blocked.

This is the second one. The state machine is deliberately small, because a watcher that comments on
every push is just a different kind of noise:

| tracker issue | current state | action |
|---|---|---|
| absent | red | **open** the tracking issue |
| last comment `red` | red | nothing (repeated failures are not 25 comments) |
| last comment `red` | green | comment "back to green" |
| last comment `green` | red | comment "red again" |
| last comment `green` | green | nothing |
| absent | green, or unknown | nothing |

**Transitions only** — the same reason a good alert fires on state change rather than on every sample.

The tracking issue is *whichever open issue carries the `site-build-red` label*. That is the whole
contract with the maintainer: label an existing issue and the watcher comments there instead of opening
a duplicate (as #2136 was), and unlabel or close it and the next red build opens a fresh one. The
watcher never closes an issue itself — a green build is evidence, and whether that closes the issue is
the maintainer's call, not a script's.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/workers_builds_watch.py --event "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH"   # from check_suite
    python3 scripts/workers_builds_watch.py --branch main                  # scheduled safety net
    python3 scripts/workers_builds_watch.py --dry-run ...                  # print, write nothing

Env: `GH_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`), `GH_REPO` (default `Ikalus1988/MisakaNet`), `GH_API_BASE`
