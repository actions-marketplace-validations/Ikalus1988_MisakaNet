"""Check that the sources a lesson cites actually exist.

Why this exists: `scripts/lesson_gate.py` checks structure, DCO checks signatures and
`scripts/injection_scan.py` checks for prompt-injection shapes — none of them can tell
whether a `source:` URL is real. On 2026-09-16 four lesson PRs (#1713–#1716) passed
24/24 checks while every one of them cited
`https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp-memory-service/issues/1652`, a repository
that returns 404. In a corpus whose value proposition is *verifiable* failure memory,
an invented source is worse than an absent one: it looks checkable and is not.

Two rule tiers, because legacy debt must not block every future PR:

  tier 1 (always fails)   a placeholder URL, or a URL that is confirmed dead (404/410)
                          and is not recorded in the baseline
  tier 2 (--strict-new)   a lesson that claims `evidence_level: E2`/`E3`. Only applied to
                          *newly added* files, the same strict/advisory split the lesson
                          gate uses for structural rules (see
                          .github/workflows/lesson-gate.yml). Split in two, because the two
                          halves are not equally provable:

  tier 2a (fails)         it cites *nothing at all* — no citation key carries any value.
                          This is decidable offline, so it fails (open-code-review §2.3:
                          the branch printed a ⚠️ and still exited 0, so a step named
                          "newly added lessons must justify a high evidence level"
                          enforced nothing). It used to be an advisory and could not fail.
  tier 2b (advisory)      it cites something, but nothing could be confirmed resolvable
                          (`unknown`, 403/429, offline). Failing here would fail on the
                          *absence* of evidence, which this gate never does.

Statuses are deliberately conservative: a network failure, a timeout, a rate limit or an
unusual HTTP code is `unknown` and never fails the build — the gate only fails on
evidence, never on the absence of it.
