# Always Add Tests with Code Changes to Pass CI Coverage Gates

## Problem

CI workflows that check "changed tests fail without the change" fail when developers modify source code without adding corresponding test files. This is the #1 preventable CI failure pattern, accounting for 21% of PR-related failures in a 52-case analysis across 4 repositories.

The CI failure message reads: `FAIL - src/ changed but no test was added or modified`

## Root Cause

The CI workflow compares `git diff` of `src/` against `tests/`. If source files changed but no test files were added or modified, the CI gate rejects the PR. This is a common pattern in repos that enforce test coverage for all code changes.

The gate exists to prevent untested code from reaching main, but developers consistently forget to add tests when making small refactors or bug fixes.

## Solution

### Step 1: Identify the CI gate behavior

Check if the repo has a "Changed tests fail without the change" CI job:
```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,bucket | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("test"))'
```

### Step 2: Add a test file matching the changed source

For **bug fixes**, add a test that reproduces the bug and verifies the fix:
```python
# tests/unit/test_fixed_module.py
def test_bug_fix_verifies_correct_behavior():
    """Verify the bug is fixed — this test would fail without the code change."""
    from src.module import fixed_function
    result = fixed_function(buggy_input)
    assert result == expected_output  # Would fail on old code
```

For **refactors**, add a smoke test verifying the extracted function exists and returns expected values:
```python
def test_extracted_function_exists_and_works():
    from src.module import new_helper_function
    result = new_helper_function(test_input)
    assert result is not None
    assert isinstance(result, ExpectedType)
```

### Step 3: Verify the test passes with the change and fails without it

```bash
# Run test with the change (should pass)
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_fixed_module.py -v

# Simulate "without the change" by reverting source only
git stash -- src/
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_fixed_module.py -v  # Should fail
git stash pop
```

## Verification

After pushing, verify the CI gate passes:
```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,bucket | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("Changed tests"))'
# Expected output (the gate is satisfied — the check ran and passed):
# {"name": "Changed tests fail without the change", "bucket": "success"}
#
# If the change touched code but no test, the same command exits non-zero because the
# job never reports success: `gh pr checks` treats a missing required check as a failure.
```

## Notes

- This pattern is specific to repos with strict CI gates. Not all repos enforce this.
- For documentation-only changes, the gate should be skipped (check if `docs/` or `*.md` files are excluded).
- If the gate is too strict, suggest adding path filters in the CI workflow:
  ```yaml
  - name: Check test coverage
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.changed_files, 'src/')
  ```
